"Length of battery life and remote fail often! I dependability is not there!
4 purchased 3 are in unreliable",0
"Its nice, easy to use but the batteries die in a couple of days. Not useful if I have to constantly put new batteries in. It takes 3 or 4 batteries, too expensive to use. Wish I could return it.",0
"This is a poorly designed and functioning product, and would not recommend it to friends or family. The bracket is difficult to secure to wall using nuts and screws provided in kit. The illumination is not adequate to light a normal sized painting. Changing the batteries is not easily accomplished without taking down the paint and heavy frame.",0
THE LIGHT IS JUST WRIGHT AND THE CONTROL MAKES IT EASY TO TURN ON.,1
"Great instructions, made for an easy install. Really like that there are 3 lighting effects to choose from. Remote works perfectly and has different timers- don't want to waste batteries! Great buy. I would purchase again.",1
Beautiful,1
"This was supposed to be gold, but it's a copper color.",0
"I like it very much, easy to install, good value for the money and the remote works great!",1
Easy to install and nice lighting.. also got here really fast.,1
"It's easy to set up, easy to mount, it has multiple colors, and a couple of brightness levels. But, it really is not very bright, and the pattern of light it throws is only as wide as the light itself, which is barely 12"" wide.
The description as listed is pretty accurate, and it does say only 100 lumens. Be aware, that is not very bright. I'll keep it, but I would not buy it again.",0
"The light is somewhat disappointing because although you can tell it is cheaply made with plastic, it still is a nice shape and aesthetic. The light is also pretty dim even on the highest setting. I would only recommend this if you have fairly low expectations and don’t need a light that is very bright.",0
It came in a weird orange/gold color. The part that touches the wall was orange and the arm and light was gold. Would have been nice but…eh…,0
"La lampe n'est pas assez efficace, et le retour de la lampe chez le fournisseur nous coûte plus de 30% du coût d'achat. Donc pensez y bien sérieusement avant de faire une commande.",0
"Tiene una iluminacion muy baja, la puse para resaltar un cuadro, y no funciono, ahora esta como puro adorno arriba del cuadro",0
"I really enjoy looking at this library light fixture, looks beautiful and it adds focused light into a small object which is my shelf wit Christmas decorations at the moment. Love how easy it is to turn it on and off with the tiny remote control which also provides 3 different light shades, warm , bright and dimmed white. Happy with this purchase, it was easy to install.",1
Perfect for small dark areas!,1
J'ai reçu plus vite que la date estimée; les 3 sortes d'éclairage sont fabuleux; l'aspect délicat donne un beau cachet. Très heureuse de mon choix,1
Very easy set up. Illumination for an original art work.,1
"I wish I would’ve been more on top of things when this item arrived. I would’ve returned. It looks very very cheap. The light settings are nice, but the fixture itself is crooked, uneven, dull and cheap",0
Will not buy again. Over priced plastic with poor install hardware which does not allow proper mount,0
We used it to light a print we hung where there was no power available! Remote makes using very easy. It is a nice compliment to the picture and frame! This is our 2nd. one we own. ; ),1
"The light was not bright enough when it was working, and it did not work for very long. I am NOT happy with it! I am trying to return it now, but the warranty is only for a replacement,. Since it is made in China it probably means the replacement will not be any better!",0
Brightness could be a little better. Looks good on my wall above a memorial picture in glass.,1
This light is not rechargeable. You need to replace the batteries frequently. This is not as good as the other one I purchased that was rechargeable.,0
Well I just opened it the other day and I am super pissed. Maybe it is a dud I won't get to find out because my return date has ended. I can't open the battery compartment for the remote. I have tried so hard to get it out but it is stuck. Can't turn it on I guess either. I just gave someone some free money. PISSED,0
Very easy to install.,1
The remote has to be pointed at the light to operate. Serves it purpose. A little over priced but what isn’t now days,1
The lights were easy to install and easy to use. The remote works instantly to provide accent lighting without the difficulty of hardwire.,1
I haven't even hung this up yet because I need to find a way to correct the hideous color! It is a cheap orange color in person. Definitely not the color depicted in the photo,0
"The screw template made installation a breeze. It's mostly plastic, but doesn't look cheap at all. My picture doesn't do it justice. Love that the remote allows so many options & that there are no unseemly holes in the wall or cords. Wish it was brighter, but it does the job!",1
"This light is WAY better than others in the same price category. Very easy install, love the different color settings (warm or cool and full or half light), even has a timer. 100% satisfied!",1
"Drains batteries quickly, I got rechargeable lithium batteries.. solved the problem.",1
"The description says it has an IRON arm, it’s all very cheap plastic. The color is sort of orange, it looks like it will break when you mount it. Not worth the price at all. Weighs nothing,",0
"product installed easy, works well, well pleased.",1
This little picture light is just what I was looking for!,1
"It’s a good brightness, easy to install, even had a little level on the back plate (which was removable for more accuracy). I also liked how you could turn the lights more towards the art or more straight down if you would want.
My negatives are it is a very yellow, plastic-y, shiny gold. Not really any different than shown on the listing but I guess I was hoping for the best when I bought it. Another thing I didn’t care for is that you can see all 6 individual led lights if putting it on something reflective.
I did really like the options on the remote. Not sure why anyone would want the cool light as opposed to the warm but it’s nice it has that option. Also love that you can adjust the brightness.",1
Love it!!!! It is absolutely perfect!! Easy to install!,1
"While easy to install and the remote is fine, this light is great for indoor art, but not for dartboards and should not be advertised as such. It has to be mounted too high above the board if in a case. Not effective in properly lighting the board.",0
The first one I bought did not come with a remote I was sent another one and got the remote but had to return the rest of the product back to UPS kind of hassle for the consumer but in the end it worked out. The glare is not as bad in person. It also has a little water level on it to help with leveling just that little added help. It could use a little more range of light or my print maybe a little smaller.,1
"No wires, easy install, reasonable price",1
Bought this product and after installing it was impressed with the look and options that were programmable from the comfort of my couch. Well it’s only been over a month and now does not operate at all even if you push the on/off switch on the light. Do not purchase without the warranty as you only have 30 days. Probably I’m giving up on battery powered picture lights as they are unreliable,0
Looked a little out of place for our taste. But very nice product.,1
"Works great, don’t love the color. Reminds me of more “rose gold” than “gold”. Spray painted it with rustoleum and it looks much better now!",0
The only gold about this wall light is the curve pole the rest is not gold.,0
Not too bright. Batteries fairly easy to change.,0
"The color is not all ""gold"" there is an orange shade to the arm and base of the fixture. Not overly noticeable.",1
RH on a budget! Looks just like expensive RH lights.,1
"These need to be nailed in the wall as command strips don't work. I tried using 3 of them but still fell right off the wall instantly. You'd need to commit to using these forever.

Also didn't come with remote. When tried to return says non returnable but they said keep them and give me a full refund. Strange business.",0
Feels cheap. Returning.,0
"This was easy to install. It has two lighting effects, which actually offer differing aspects of the painting! Cool and warm tones! It has a timer, too. Best of all - no wires! I cannot stand wiring all over!",1
Very easy to install and looks amazing.,1
We returned both that we ordered. Plugged one in overnight to test it. It wasn't even as bright the next day as the one we didn't plug in! Didn't waste anymore time with them after that.,0
"If you buy this light you will need to spray paint it. It works well. Good for the price but the colors being all different was not acceptable. For instance, the plastic is orange gold and the metal arm is bright gold.",0
"Les agradezco su profesionalismo . Estoy seguro que el producto funciona , solo este llegó dañado . De hecho pueden validar y les he comprado otros 4 del mismo .

Gracias y saludos .",1
"It worked great, but it didn't work for what I wanted it for.",1
Lamp is super easy to install and has nice features like 2 different light levels and a remote control. This product would be 5 star if the built in timer did more than simply turn the lamp off. It would be great if the timer could be set to come on daily at a specific time and remain on for a set period then turn off. Many decorative cordless lights have this feature.,1
"just what i needed, and works great.",1
It looks amazing. I wish the brightness was a light higher.,1
"I am thrilled with this light--so many adjustments, you're bound to like some of them! No cord (I don't plan to have it on all the time, so battery life is not an issue). You do need to understand that the ""gooseneck"" on the lamp doesn't flex--so you can swivel it back and forth but not up and down. And the lights themselves can be adjusted. Well made, and looks great. I'll try to add a picture later...",1
"It looks good. Instalation was easy, as it comes witha white paper that helps mark the spor for the scews. I thought the handle was flexible, but its not; you can only move it from side to side. The lightbulbs rotate toward wall or out, so you can adjust the light direction. The price may be a little steep, considering its plastic, but it does the job. Mine is the 13 inch. If there was a longer one, it would look better for my art, but i am satisfied overall.",1
"Nice little light! I like the different settings on the remote (bright or soft light). The timer is a nice feature. My only minor complaint is that the color was more like a rose gold than a regular gold. It didn’t quite match our frame. However, you can’t really tell unless you walk right up to it. Overall, very satisfied with my purchase.",1
"Most importantly, I found the following features bring pleasure in viewing my recent purchase: The Guardian.
1) wireless. Runs on 3 AA batteries (not included)
2) miniature level and paper template for determining placement of screws for the panel which the light easily slides
3) remote with option for bright white or amber lightening. Plus ability to brighten or dim
4) timer for auto off as I gaze before sleeping
5) one can actually rotate the lights 180 degrees as to where the light shines on art piece
I am very pleased and will order again for future pieces.",1
"I was surprised at the quality for $26-$27. It’s easy to hang, the light options are great—cool, warm or somewhere in the middle. The light rotates up and down to light your picture. We are really pleased. The remote works well too and there is an in/off button on the light itself. It could be a bit brighter but for the price we are very happy.",1
"I like the light's design, but the light is very dim. More to use for a night light than an office space.",0
"Easy install, easy to operate. Does a great job on the picture we are using it on.",1
Nice light decor over my hallway picture.,1
"Es muy fácil de instalar...prro en mi caso los tornillos que trajo no sirvieron...tiene un nivel incorporado lo que hace que el trabajo sea más fácil...el brillo, el control remoto todo muy bien...Definitivamente es un plus no tener que hacer obra para los cables. Lo recomiendo ciento x ciento.",1
I’ve already gotten so many compliments on this and have sent people the link to buy it. I love it.,1
Looks expensive and I love that its battery powered,1
"Barely shines a light at all. It doesn't light up the area, can barely tell that the light is on and I had it on at 100%. If you really need a light like this, I would not recommend it.",0
Great product and quality,1
"This is, without a doubt, the highest quality piece of equipment that I have ever bought on Amazon.",1
"I’m actually really disappointed in this item! I had high hopes but it’s just not worth the money. The battery life is terrible, the “brightness” isn’t bright at all and there is very little % difference when using the remote",0
Very easy install,1
Love these for the aesthetic but not super bright If that’s what you’re looking for,1
This worked well for the space but if the arm extend a little further out it would have been better. Very good value and looks nice,1
Had it less than 1 year and it quit working.,0
The whole thing apart from the stem is a copper color. Doesn't match if pairing with a gold framed painting.,0
"I’ve been having to use this just as decoration because the remote won’t cut on and I bought the necessary batteries for this item. I had this product for about 4 months but I’m extremely frustrated because I wanted to use this as a light not just for decoration. I also, don’t know who to contact with the product not being from USA.",0

This is a tremendous light for the price. Looks great and the warm and cool lighting differential is superb. Not to mention the time and light volume options. Picture depicts warm light option. Exceeded expectations.,1
"You can attach those with a 3M “sticker”. Love that they come with a remote that has a timer.
Super cute and have no cons about them.",1
"This light works wonderfully, it's the remote that is a bit hit or miss. I originally gave this a bad review, but my husband got this light working, and it really is a good product.",1
"I love this picture light. The only problem I had was nailing it to the wall above my Bachelor of Arts degree. It appears that my wall is not cooperating with the hammer and nails. It keeps bending. I think I would have to buy a drill and secure it like that. All and all I was able to place it on a table near the frame and let the light shine upon it. LOL , hey its cool. What I didn't like was the remote control. It appears to be difficult to open and to operate. We can't open the small case to see what type of batteries are needed. Bummer!. However, I love, love, love the picture light and will buy it again for all my other degrees and certificates. It really is a great help in highlighting one's own personal achievements. It sells at a great and affordable price too.",1
"Fácil de colocar, el color un poco amarillento pero la retoque con pintura en aerosol negra solo chispazos para dar un toque de oro viejo y el resultado genial 🥰",1
Wish it was a little brighter,1
"Very basic, simple",1
Beautifully showcases paintings,1
"Good quality and the remote/brightness modes are excellent but the “gold” color is really an odd orange/copper. The artwork I was going to pair it with has some gold paint and a gold frame which made the copper color stick out like a sore thumb. Even my husband (who has zero interest home decor - ha!) made a comment that it looked tacky.

That said, would still highly recommend the product if the black or silver colors suit your needs!",0
Love this little light! It looks so cute and it only took a sec to install. The light can be a white light or a warmer tone. You can dim it and put it on a timer. The fixture is easy to get off & change the batteries if need be. The “gold” tone looked a little orange so I did as other buyers did & spray painted it with some gold spray paint. Turned out great. Works via remote or a button on the device. Accidentally ran the remote through the washer & it still works. Yay!,1
"Very cheap looking product, even for price. Plastic is two different tones and very cheaply made. I didn’t even try installing it. Returned!",0
Wonderful,1
"The unit looks great, just doesn’t highlight enough for my liking.",1
"Nice little light, but it died after a couple months. Tried to replace batteries in light and remote with no luck. Tossed in garbage.",0
Bought this to accent a photo and antique desk and quite frankly I can barely tell when it is turned on.... It's highlighting nothing!!!. So disappointed!!!! Now the light is not even working .. Can You please comp me a new one... Help,0
Perfect for my RV,1
The gold is NOT GOLD. It’s orange and looks terrible!!!,0
"These work well. I love that there is a timer. Also, I didn’t realize I much prefer the warm light to the bright light for viewing paintings. I have 2 artworks that are about 32” to the bottom and not quite bright enough to the bottom. I have 2 other similar light that are only white light and no timer and paid twice as much. If you have a drill, laser level and measuring tape - installs in minutes. I actually used other wall anchors and screws because the included ones are somewhat small. If you used daily it would require a lot of batteries and may want to consider rechargeable. Not sure, but guessing 20 hrs life with 3 AAA batteries",1
I was extremely excited to get this in and bring attention to one of my favorite paintings but it’s so fun it’s basically nonexistent. I’ve tried messing with the batteries and the remote settings and it doesn’t get any brighter. It’s really too bad!,0
"The remote control is very convenient. The lighting can be changed to 2 types of lighting controlled by the remote control.
The design of the light is minimal which is great and the eye focuses more on the painting or photo rather than the light itself. I order two and love them.",1
Very pretty and easy to hang picture light if you don’t want to hardwire. disappointed mine came damaged with a noticeable dent . Will have to re order,1
All the various options for light effect.,1
"I liked this a lot, but it stopped working after about three months of use. Disappointing, especially for something you have to install",0
"Play Video
 Love it beautiful",1
Perfect light for my artwork,1
Works great and highlights my pic that's mounted very high. Great accent.,1
"Very easy to install, love the timer on the remote",1
I do enjoy this product. I just wish it was a bit brighter.,1
"Didn't want to buy it but my wife was insistent. I thought it looked cheap, but it's actually pretty cool once we received it.",1
It’s not gold but copper. I forgot to read the reviews!,0
"This puts out light in a very small area. We have a picture that's 3.5 feet high. It only lights up one-third of the painting. The workmanship is shoddy, which we could deal with if it would do the job.",0
Very nice.,1
This is such a great product!,1
The light is not bright enough.,0
"I love the detail and is not expensive and is not heavy but I do not like false marketing if say Gold I want Gold color but this is Bronze, Hello Huuuuugeeee difference! And that is very bad for customer experience! Please team level up and be clear on the Color because now Im in the way to home depot to buy a gold spray !!",0
"J'ai utilisé ce produit afin d'éclairer une toile installée dans mon salon qui lorsque le soir arrivé était dans un endroit sombre, maintenant la lumière lui redonne toute sa splendeur.",1
"I have already changed the battery to make sure it wasnt the battery, bit this light stopped working with literally weeks of use. Shame. Do not recommend it",0
Purchased this picture light for a picture where there was no access to electricity. Worked fairly well for the first week or two but went through batteries very quickly. Then it simply stopped working. Changed the batteries in the light and the remote. Still nothing. Terrible product at a ridiculously high price.,0
"I bought this and was happy with it , but that was short lived. I bought it to go over a piece of art. I only turned it in stem guests were in my home. I didn’t use this light very much. When it wouldn’t come on I thought the battery was dead. I Changed the batteries with multiple batteries. I tried batteries from different packs. No luck. There is no way to change the battery in the remote without breaking it. By the time I noticed this was not working, the return date had passed. In my opinion, this light is not worth purchasing.",0
Balcony,1
"Perhaps the would work for a small (short) pc. of work. The light only illuminated the top few inches of the painting. adjusting did little good. Mounting it lower, closer to the picture, just made for ugly reflection of the bulbs in the glass. Not for me.",0
I love it,1
Product came without remote and now won't work. I replaced all 2 batteries and it still won't come on.,0
"Beautiful design and finish, easy to install
BUT Harsh 3-4 thousand cold Kelvin temperature lighting.
As bad as bluish fluorescent. I would suggest manufacturer change to 2700 Kelvin or less led strips ... they are available in China or allowing the remote to vary the Kelvin temperature to correct this obvious deficiency",0
"If you are looking for way to accentuate an artwork, this light is the answer. Love the fact that it has a remote control. It allows me to turn it on and off when lying on my sofa. What a breeze!",1
Delivered very quickly! Wonderful light!,1
"Works well over picture, like new control options",1
Too blue and too focused. Need light to be more flood like and less spot like.. returned without a problem.,0
I am very happy with this product. I would have given a third option for the intensity and colour of the light but it is pretty OK,1
"Lighting large painting, light looks good but would be better on smaller painting since light doesn’t reach beyond middle of painting",1
"I like how easy to install and beautiful lights..
Highly recommended.",1
Not at all like the picture. It's not gold. It's more yellowish and it looks soooo cheap. Ugh... what a waste of money,0
Feels cheap and looks cheap. Returned.,0
"I’ve had these lights for about a year and when I tell u I wish I never bought them. Like everyone with a honest review says, it DRAINS the batteries, very quickly. A few hours per night will need new battery change in a week if u want to maintain optimal brightness. How expensive then is this product if you’re constantly buying batteries? The color was an ugly orange/copper so I spray painted it. If they would just paint it a true gold color n fix the evil wiring problem, it might be worth something. DONT BUY!! This product is garbage and wastes so much money.",0
Nice inexpensive starter light to accent art or paintings,1
Very easy to install. Provides good illumination for a picture or painting,1
"I will be buying more of these for other pieces, I love it. Very easy to install, light weight & I LOVE the remote control with all of the lighting options! This needlework I did looks a little wonky & crooked cause I carried it around for 40+ years unfinished, finally finished it & matted it with handmade papyrus & thought it deserved special lighting. It's my 1st & last needlepoint, so tedious....lol",1
"The light is okay but not as good as we would have liked for the following reasons:

When the lamp is on, the light reflect several dots onto the painting. It looks ridiculous, like airport runway lights. There seems to be no way to diminish or remove the dots without turning off the lamp.

We expecting light to emanate from the fixture without the bulbs throwing off 12 dots onto the canvas.",0
"For the price, it’s OK, but I wouldn’t recommend.",0
Love it!,1
It’s very attractive. Doesn’t give a huge brightness but adequate. I still think an excellent value.,1
I purchased 3 of these and very happy with them thay gave my jazz 3D art stand out even more.and i can change the lighting color to fit my social dinner moods.my friends was very impressed with what i paid for them and so was i.very happy customer.,1
Made my picture show up beautifully. I have ordered another one for over the picture of my Savior.,1
"It was super easy to install as it has a built in level, uses 3 AA batteries and a remote that lets you change the power up & down and a built in timer.",1
A battery eater. Looks nice but feels cheap. You're fine as long as no one touches it.,0
"This is cheap and absolutely not wort it. We bought because of the reviews but in hindsight, the reviews seems fake. The brightness isn't bad but the plastic is clearly bad and looks cheap. Returned the item, would never buy again.",0
Used these lights to highlight a picture and I also use them when I gave theses shelves a facelift! The lights are remote and can be dimmed. A beautiful finishing touch!,1
I used this light over the picture of each child.,1
Great if you can’t hardwire and are ok with led light!,1
Didn’t want to mount yo wall so I used two sided tape. Holds well. The remote works great on timer and the amount of light chosen. Looks really good at end of a hall on painting.,1
Seems to function fine but the color is definitely not what is pictured. It is a rose gold.,0
Cheap looking - didn't even use it.,0
Impossible to open battery compartment.,0
Product looks like painted plastic & the color is very very orange instead of yellow/gold.,0
"This product looks great and is inexpensive. However, be prepared to change batteries often. If you purchase, only turn on when company is over. If you want an everyday painting light (or have a large painting), consider another product.",1
Battery only lasted two days,0
So mad at myself for missing the return window on these. Absolut junk. Cheap look. And all lights are crooked!! Terrible. Spend more money and get something proper.,0
I love the brightness and very easy to install.,1
Can't open the remote control to change battery. Remote is not working.... only had it 4 months.,1
Super easy to mount. The remote control is such a plus also. I can turn it on and off without much effort. If I could add one thing it would be to offer a more muted gold.,1
"This is an excellent addition to a darker gallery wall in my home. I am unsure how long the batteries will last, and I was disappointed in the finish. The face was chipped in transit and it obvious with illuminated.",1
Easy to install and use,1
Works great! Mounting takes less than 15 minutes. You can rotate the lighting elements to provide more or less illumination. Remote works fine. No complaints.,1
The only thing I don’t like is to replace all of the batteries which is too soon all the time,1
Looks good for the money. Could be a little brighter,1
Its orange. Its really orange . Its going back.,0
It’s two different colors!! The rod is brass and the actual light is copper. It looks super orangey in real life. I didn’t even bother taking it out of the package it’s so bad. So disappointed,0
"Looks more plastic than the photos. Batteries don’t last very long, but light is focused and they work for now.",0
Love my lamps. Super bright and easy to assemble. I don’t have complaints,1
"Picture is gold - it’s more like a brass tone to it.
Don’t remember a remote with it.
Looks nice",1
Difficult to install,1
"I have been searching high and low for sconces that are battery powered and modern looking. These are a perfect fit above our art work. They are easy to install, and love that there are no cords for plug in.",1
It looks great and works well,1
"I ended up not using this for what I wanted to use it for, but what little I did use it, it worked well. The light is strong and adjustable and it mounts pretty firmly. It's nice to light up a painting. It won't be able to do much for super big paintings though, so keep that in mind. If you want to give even lighting on a large painting you'll need to get something more heavy duty. For a normal size painting that doesn't need exact lighting, though, this is nice.",1
Lasted two months. Not good quality,1
It all seems great so far!,1
"Removed a star because the base and light are a different shade of gold color than the stem because the stem is metal and the base/light piece are plastic. But for the price, its good. The mounting piece has a built in level that made it very easy to hang and the lights do a great job for what i needed them for. Will prob buy again and just give it all a coat of rustoleum gold spray paint to make it look more uniform.",1
"Love the look. Sits a little crooked (leans forward) as it’s top heavy, even though I used the paper template and followed the directions. Comes with wall anchors but it’s not heavy enough to need them; plus my drywall is so thin, which could be why it’s leaning forward, that the anchors just went straight into the wall and disappeared. Maybe someone will find it 100 years from now like a love letter. “Dear drywall…”",1
"Love that this is a picture light to light pictures in places I could not run a cord down to. Lighting options between the warm and a cool work very well. And the light quality is very good. However, I will say, it burns through batteries very fast. Put on a dim setting with only on the warm light setting at 50% or less and I guess I get maybe two to three days worth of lighting out of it at, 4 hours a day. Thank goodness I use rechargeable batteries to light these, though I really don't like having to replace them every 3 days to keep the light on. Wish there was a more battery conscious option to this product. Any suggestions out there?",0
"I had my doubts about these... I knew that the paintings in corner of my den needed some lighting, but the thought of having a cord hanging down the wall was untenable to me. Cutting in two outlets on the wall behind the paintings could be easily accomplished, but if the paintings ever came down, the outlets would have had to be removed. This installation remains a possibility.

In the meantime, these lights serve to reinforce the notion that this corner needs lighting. They were simple to install, taking less than 10 minutes each. The lighting modes offer more variety than most plug in lights, and the dimming feature allows you to both extend battery life while adjusting to the lighting needs of the moment. The timer feature is also useful for extending battery life. It turns off what I forgot.

There is a clever little bubble level integral to the mounting bracket that made the installation that much easier. The only adjustment that I had to make was in the field of light coming from the unit. The lights throw a full 180 degrees of light, which resulted for me in light shining above the paintings and frames and onto the wall. I remedied this by placing electrician's tape across the upper section of the lens of the light. Depending on the size of your piece, you may want to similarly adjust the range of lighting. This modification does not show in the room.

I found that mounting it as close to the frame as possible was the best placement for the light. Mounting it above the frame resulted in highlighting the space between the frame and the lights' base.

To sum up, the light is inexpensive, easily installed, versatile, and effective. I can enthusiastically recommend it to anyone who finds himself wanting to light up a framed piece of artwork without undertaking a small home wiring project.",1
OK,1
Love how easy this is to use. Perfect for showing off our paintings.,1
"Seriously, 83 five star and only five star reviews, all on the same day? And all in non standard English.",0
"There’s absolutely nothing negative to say about this lighting. Super easy to set up, literally it took me two minutes. It looks amazing at night. I am not one to right reviews but sometimes you should. You will thank me later. It looks expensive, very good material. Don't hesitate to get it.",1
"Attractive, choose warm or cool light, and timed ""on"" programs.",1
It is pretty heavy. Does not work for the picture I had intended. Unable to position. Arm is not movable.,1
"This picture light is very pretty, but I wouldn't buy it if you really need a bright light. No matter how I adjust it, it still just puts a very small spot of light across my picture. Remote works well. Batteries don't last long. I only use it occasionally and have already had to replace the batteries after only a month.",0
It was very easy to install but the remote difficult to navigate.,1
"I love my picture light. It's really pretty and does a great job of lighting my art. It is also offered at an affordable price. The company, Luxsway, also has great customer service! I had an issue and they gave me help freely and quickly, even though I was past the return date. I like this company a lot and will be buying from them in the future! Good people, good product!",1
Easy to install,1
"Easy to use and the remote works great. Bright enough for a basic picture light but for those that though they might able to adapt for other uses like a stairway light, its just not bright enough. Not much brighter than a night light. Color is also an over the coppery collar and so kind of a tacky color. Will not look like copper -- more orange/copper mix.",0
"I ordered this with trepidation based on reviews but, for $30, I figured it couldn’t be all bad. Boy, was I wrong. It came out of the bag with wall paint splatters on it! So not only did they send me a flimsy piece of plastic, but they sent me a USED piece of flimsy plastic. This one is definitely going back.",0
Wish you could manipulate the neck of the light. Not bright enough to light it up well.,1
Ok,1
"No matter how the light is directed, the brightness of the light is not adequate for the size of my framed art. It only lit the top part of the art piece.",0
Fantastic!,1
"Was easy to install, illuminates the painting perfect. Would buy again if needed for another project.",1
Great quality for the price. Easy install and looks great.,1
"Me agrado, lo practica, que es, y todas las funciones, del control remoto",1
Nice,1
"I bought this in March of 2021, so almost two years ago, which means it's not that old. Battery inside fixture died, so I tried to change it but only the first of three came out. The second and third are stuck inside a thick layer of corrosion. I broke a paring knife trying to get them out! Do not buy this item!",0
Very easy to use and install. I wish they were rechargable instead of battery operated.,1
Great product for the price ! Very easy to install.,1
This light is super easy to install! Even has a built in level! I could not be happier! Looks great! A+++,1
"Wish I could make the light a little brighter. But it does the job! Not going to lie, it's a bit bulky but it fit behind our painting well. A cool feature is that the lights rotate. You can change the color of the lighting from warm to cool lighting. I prefer the warm lighting. The remote also has a timer! Overall a good buy",1
That it made of plastic.,1
Works well.,1
"Really loved these but after just 2 months they completely stopped working. We’ve barely used them and tried changing the batteries and using a new remote, but still dead. I saw others complain about this issue when I was reading reviews prior to purchasing and figured it wouldn’t happen, but of course it did. Save your money.",0
"I have it over an oil painting that is 24"" wide and 28"" tall. The light is just adequate for that size painting.The cool bulbs are very effective for this particular painting but it would better serve a smaller painting. The remote is a good feature and works well.",0
Makes my art POP!! So good. Built in level for mounting helps so much.,1
Purchased this picture light for a picture where there was no access to electricity. Worked fairly well for the first week or two but went through batteries very quickly. Then it simply stopped working. Changed the batteries in the light and the remote. Still nothing. Terrible product at a ridiculously high price.,0
"We just wanted a battery operated picture light. We love the additional options that are available on the remote. There is button for a yellow light or white light, 50% lighting or 100% lighting also a plus and minus button for brightness. The variety of timing options are nice. Each light is movable outward or inward. This light is a winner for our needs!",1
"I think this item is a good dupe to a very expensive picture light. I think it looks a little plastic looking when you first open it up, but once it’s on the wall, you can’t really tell. Definitely a good affordable option that gives off the same effect as an expensive light.",1
Love the easy installation. I love the way it looks.Highlight is perfect. The warm light or white choice is great as it help changing the mood...,1
This light is so cute over my picture! It is easy to install and looks very classy!,1
Very nice quality but could be a bit brighter. Would buy again.,1
"I wanted an inexpensive art statement light above a large piece of artwork above my piano. I loved the remote control to turn it on at night. I did not use this nightly as I would just forget to turn it on; however the remote and/or the LED light stopped working after 5-6 months and keep in mind, I didn't log hundreds of hours of use before it died. Maybe 15 total hours. Disappointed.",0
This is very cheap looking and bulky,0
"Overall, the lights do the job I bought for which I bought them. Remote makes it very convenient to operate. The installation was somewhat a pain. The built in level is pretty much useless. The fluid for the level is so thick, the bubble takes forever to move. Then, when bubble centers, it is not correct. I verified this with my on level. Bought 3 lights. All were like this.",0
"I purchased 2 pieces, only 1 is working , the second one can’t operate at all",0
" Perfect for what I needed and wanted, looks like a nice brass lamp, nobody will know different. Love the different settings and the fact it has a remote with timer.",1
"I’m not one to rewrite reviews much, but the manufacturer of this product thought of everything. I was thoroughly impressed with the paper that they used to help guide the install of the screws, which were provided. Also, remote control is outstanding with a bunch of options. (One suggestion to the manufacturer, maybe they can add a dusk dawn timer instead of just 120 minutes on the timer). Lastly, the lights themselves rotate so you can place the lights where you want them on your painting.
Thank you so much for making such quality product.",1
I loved this so much I ordered another one. After a few days the first one I ordered stopped working. It would only go to about 30%. When I explained that I didn’t want to take the back plate off the wall for fear of damage I got in touch with Amazon and they are sending me a replacement!! I’m happy because the light is really great and does a good job lighting my artwork along a dark hallway. The fixture itself is somewhat subdued and doesn’t detract from the pieces of art it’s illuminating. It was super easy to hang and I’m just hoping they will not all stop working after a few days. If they continue to work I plan on buying one for all my artwork!,1
"This is yellow. Not gold. It’s the worst color I’ve ever seen and now I’m
Stuck with 2 of them.",0
Also like the versatility of different settings and dim control. Remote is convenient. Good buy.,1
"This light is not very bright
Actually a waste of money!",0
" I love everything about the way this looks. Only issue I have is the batteries. The batteries die in a couple days if you forget to turn it off.

Don’t waste your money. Just buy a rechargeable version.",1
Bought this and just started using less than 10 weeks ago and it stopped working. Tried putting new batteries in and everything - nothing worked.,0
I bought 2 of these. The bulbs did not generate enough light to light the paintings. The batteries run down quickly generating even less light. I ended up throwing them away. They actually look great but did not do the job I bought them for.,0
Easy to install and works great. Adds a touch of class to the room,1
"These are affordable and give me the look I was going for, but I bought two at two different times and they are not the same color. I ordered the same ones. I’m going to have to spray paint them and probably use Rub n Buff to get the look I want.",1
Easy to install and works as advertised,1
Just got it today and it took less than a minute to hang. It is really lightweight so I was able to hang it with command strips which is really nice. The built in level is a good feature too. The gold color looks kinda cheap in person. Overall it’s great though. Hoping it lasts!,1
This product is amazing. I bought it and then my brother saw it & ordered. My best friend saw it and ordered. I saw it on YouTube the girl name was DIY with KIVA and she had a link and that is how I bought it.,1
Third one ordered. Great for highlighting our framed pics. Enjoy the warm and bright shades. Excellent product.,1
She wanted something to mount on the wall to highlight a small relief carving that she has had for years. This light really does make the carving 'pop'.,1
Very nice,1
It’s rare to find something at this price that both does its job and has great extras! Includes thoughtful instruction details and super little remote.,1
"It is way to dim to light up larger paintings,I've tried both switches and ways to dark.Very disapointed",0
This product is terrible. It drains the batteries even when it's not on. I checked batteries with voltmeter before putting them in they are fully charged the light is off the next day I go to turn it on it won't come on take the batteries out check with voltmeter batteries are dead It must have some sort of short it was a waste of $36 don't buy this I couldn't be any more disappointed,0
"This was a great solution for someone who doesn't want to mess with having to plug in a picture light. Although the parts are plastic and the curved arm does not match the light display piece or the mounting piece, at a distance it isn't really too obvious. Also, as another reviewer noted, the brass version is tinged in the orange direction, but as yet another reviewer noted, it is probably an option to tape over the light band and lightly spray the entire piece with a gold spray, thereby toning down the orange and creating a common color for all three parts. I might try that at some point, but my picture light is at a distance, so the tones don't particularly bother me. Otherwise, great features, good lighting, well done for the price!",1
Great Value!,1
I loved the light fixture style however I didn’t appreciate that the golds were two different colors. One brass and the other one a darker gold finish. I spray painted the hole thing after covering the lights and it came out amazing. Checkout the photos,1
"where is the quality control? Remote wouldn't turn on, lights are unevenly bright, neck doesn't adjust so with my long painting (much longer than it is wide), the light it too bright at the top and doesn't reach the bottom.",0
"Luxway picture light, remote does not work, very disappointing, the time I have tried new batterys and try to fix it is crazy, please send me a new remote that works. Thank you Terry Todd",0
"I wanted to create a cozy ambience in my classroom, but keep it looking classy. This light did just that!",1
"These lights are great value especially for the price. They were very easy to install, the remote control has several features that allow to choose the level of brightness, white or warm light, and timer. I am very pleased with the lights.",1
Color of the product does not match the description.. Awful... One part is orange gold and other is yellow gold. Very disappointed.,0
This a great product. Did exactly what I needed to do. Also amazing customer service.,1
"The look was what I wanted , the light felt cheap and was defective.",0
I got it for relatively big pictures. More appropriate for small pictures.,0
Good buy for the money. Nice variation in colors of light.,1
Appearance is fine. All works as it should. Light quality is average. The neck where the light is attached does not extend from the wall very far. When there is even a moderately heavy from the light does not extend well enough to cast a good light over the painting. Too bright just by the lamp and poorly lit otherwise.,0
Very low lumix. I bought it to use as a spotlight for a 3x4 poster. Its light is unnoticed. Returned one of 2 pcs I bought.,0
Perfect fit and lighting,1
Was easy to install,1
Looks nice and the remote works great but the light it provides is barely visible. Dissatisfied.,0
"This light was well made, easy to install, and has good light output. There's a built in timer to automatically shut off the light after a predetermined time interval, and battery life is good",1
Good for price,1
Love the look! Easy to install and gives a great look. I’ll probably buy more for other areas of the house.,1
 Easy to use! Easy to mount! Love the lighting settings! Comes with a Remote!,1
Works fine but is better for shorter pictures. Lights top of painting but not angled properly for lighting whole painting. Happy with light and remote very handy. Would recommend for shorter art.,0
Love it!,1
Hubby always wants to know how I come up with these type of things. It's a perfect addition to my living area. We placed it over our anniversary picture going up the stairs. Batteries last long and i like the different brightness it provides depending on mode.,1
I love how easy it is to install. It looks great and does the job it is intended for.,1
"This item was much smaller than I expected. Now, I have something that I can not use.",0
Very easy to put up and it looks great on,1
Like the remote. But don’t lose it. It’s small,1
"Good value! Can’t beat the price and it works well. Like other reviews said, the color is definitely a more orange gold. The middle metal part is yellow gold. Then the base and the hood around the light is plastic and a more orange almost brass color. I wanted a more settle gold so I spray painted it and it came out good. Very easy to install and sturdy. I would use the screws it comes with. I used the correct command strips at first and it fell pretty soon after. With the screws though it’s all set! I would have given it five stars if the color matched the pictures better and if it was all an even color",1
"We put this on a stone fireplace above a special piece of art. We thought it would be difficult because of the uneven surface of the stones, but it worked! The template helped a LOT!

Nice light with warm or cool options, bright or dimmer. The ONLY complaint I have is that the longest timer setting is just two hours. Wish it were longer.",1
So disappointing with thousands of positive reviews. Light barely illuminates top 1/4 of my painting. Need a telescoping arm to cover large painting. ...this one is fixed. Sent it back. Maybe its ok for very small paintings.,0
"Nice product, but it is missing the remote control. Too much hassle to send it back. Send remote if you can. Otherwise suggest better quality control in packing and shipping.",0
"Cheaply made.
Did not work",1
The light looks nice above our picture however the remote does not work and the light does not work we changed the battery tried everything. I hate to return since it is mounted on the wall will contact seller for a new remote,0
"I bought two of these. At first, I thought it was a steal for the price. Sadly, they provide zero light. I mean, I want to light up the entire painting, not just the top of the frame. You’re better off taping a flashlight to your wall. They’re going back tomorrow morning. Extremely disappointed!",0
Great light for the price. Wall installation made easy with removable mounting bracket with built in leveler in it.,1
"The light is a great concept, it is bent, I tried to install, it does not line up… cannot use, I only tried to install last week",0
Wasn’t sure how they would look as lighting for my bedroom but they worked out great. They make my room look cozy and ambient. Would love to use them elsewhere.,1
"Lights stopped working and was RARELY USED. So now I have 6 nonfunctional lights, past return deadline. DO NOT BUY. Don’t make the same mistake.",0
I’m OBSESSED with this art lamp!!! My father in law surprised us with a painting of our wedding venue for Christmas and this lamp gives it just the spotlight it deserves!!! It added so much to our display and I am so pleased with this product! Super easy to install- is super lightweight and even has a little build in level for perfect installation! Love the added touch of the remote and the different settings. Can be set to cool or warm light and can adjust the brightness as well as set timers for automatic shut off! BUY THIS!,1
Purchased this picture light for a picture where there was no access to electricity. Worked fairly well for the first week or two but went through batteries very quickly. Then it simply stopped working. Changed the batteries in the light and the remote. Still nothing. Terrible product at a ridiculously high price.,0
Looks so cheap with 2 shades of gold,0
The bulb or battery ran out . We need replacement battery or bulb or both. Where do we find this?,1
"The product was very easy to install. There is a panel in back that comes off and it even has a mini level on it. The only thing that didnt work was the anchor bolts it came with, ended up pushing one right through into the wall.

The product looks nice hanging up. Up close the curved metal pole is a different color (more yellow gold) than the metallic looking plastic the rest of it is made out of. It isn't obvious when it is mounted.

I find it very functional. Two light options and both look nice. Remote works well. Have not tested the timers out but it is a nice feature.",1
"This product displays artwork beautifully and the remote offers many options including a timer. Also, one remote is all that's needed to operate multiple lights.",1
"Our 50th Anniversary picture was done on the steps of a beautiful old home, now a bed and breakfast. There are 20 of us in the picture. When others come to my home one of the first things I do is turn on that light over the picture and watch their reaction. The light makes the picture come to life. Love it!!!",1
Batteries last a really long time. Good brightness. The warm white color or cold white are equally bright. The remote control with dimmer and timer is handy.,1
Looks great above expensive original artwork. Definitely looks more expensive than it is!,1
"Works great, looks very nice, easy to install. The batteries will be easy to change after installed as well. The built in level makes installation easy. Varying light tone and dimming feature allow for the perfect look. Great product",1
Easy to install. Looks good.,1
"Arrived early and in excellent shape. The product description is accurate except for one thing. It is better than described. This is my first picture light so maybe I am just ignorant of these things. I am impressed. This light makes the picture pop. I had to place my picture in a dark area of the room. It becomes the focal point with this light.
The product appeared to be cheap because it was very light but its weight is misleading. This was easy to install properly with the provided template.
The remote control is awesome. You can change the color of the light and the brightness.. The timers are real battery savers.",1
Gives off a nice amount of light and remote works good. I did spray paint it to the color gold I wanted. I'd buy again.,1
Works just as described with several brightness and color tone options. Convenient remote control and battery operated for easy installation. Looks a bit cheap in person but for the price it does what it’s meant to do.,1
Absolutely love these! I bought two lights as a gift for my husband to hang over some of his canvas paintings in his office. Everything works as expected and looks amazing!! Will probably be buying more,1
Very easy to install with built in leveler.,1
"We did not even use them everyday for less than month and no longer than 6 hrs when we do but they have completely drained the batteries. Each light requires 3 batteries. The light is not as bright as we expected as well. Unfortunately, it's past the return window. Too bad because we liked how it had a remote control and a timer and 3 different color options. It's not worth it in my opinion.",0
I was looking for a cordless picture light and purchased this item. It did not suit the picture and area that we were using it for. When I tried to return it I found out it could not be returned… now I have a $75 light with nowhere to use it.,0
"The light was slightly lopsided. I could not get it straightened, so it looks lopsided hanging over my picture.",1
"Comes with remote, which is extremely easy to use. You can control the brightness, even has a timer. Very pleased with light!",1
Just love this little light. We wanted it above our new Samsung Frame TV. It added just the right tough. We didn’t paint it and loved the color.,1
It was great while it lasted. And wasn't able to get a refund or exchange for product. Do not recommend buying!,0
These are great to have. We have been using them for my boyfriends artwork around the house. With some Baroque frames it looks like a museum. Will submit photo soon. The remote is great and east to use. The batteries i feel like drain fast but that's expected.,1
Our Peter Max picture is highlighted perfectly,1
"For $68 it is not worth it. The light colour are warm or bright with timers, that’s nice but that’s about it. The “gold” light has a traditional gold neck but the two end pieces are more rose gold, fake plastic which I’ve tried to capture in the photos. I talked to “influencers” who bought this in USA and theirs is much better and for $25. If you’re in Canada do not buy this product unless you’re desperate and maybe buying black as it’ll probably be all the same shade. Definitely going to return, sadly.",0
I like the chrome design and simplicity of this light. It tends to suck away battery power really quickly. Having to put in new batteries is really easy cause you can flick it off the wall. Note: you cannot move this from left to right. It is in a fixed position but you can move the lights up and down. I love the look it makes for my paintings and the remote is cool to change from warm light to led. I wish it had better battery life.,1
Absolutely gorgeous. Love the control options. A must have accent lighting piece for any decor piece.,1
Exelent quality fast delivery exelente description and communications,1
I had doubts about how long the batteries would last. Been three months and I turn it on for two to three hours a night. Timer feather is great. You can even select between warm and bright light. Dim it. Looks great especially since there is not a cord.,1
It did not serve the purpose needed,0
Gift for my daughter’s boyfriend. He loves it.,1
These are a very practical and inexpensive means to illuminate artwork where power cords may present a distraction or no power source is available. Long lasting LED lights are powered by batteries. May require a modicum of creativity to mount them effectively to specific projects. (Mine required the addition of a plastic tab and hook/loop fastener strip.),1
I love everything about it,1
I bought the black ones. Super easy install! Very happy with this purchase!,1
This lamp design is most appealing and very lightweight. I will order more for our home.,1
Works great and lights up my photo great,1
Bought in February 2022 and noticed in August it was not working working when trying to turn it on by remote. Now in November 2022 I tested batteries in light and they were still good since I only used the light on occasion. Replaced batteries and still nothing with either using the remote or the button on the light. Extremely disappointed and now I have a light on my wall that doesn't work or have to remove and repair the holes. Waste of money and time to install with it not even lasting a full year.,0
The light should be brighter if you have a picture larger than 11X14. plus mats.,1
Other product reviews indicate that this light covers more area than it does. Actually this photo shows it a lot better than it does in person. The first pic is in a dark room - the second is in a lite up room. Neither is to the quality we had been used to where the painting just jumped out at you.,0
"Looks and works well
Battery life is the only down side
Great option when hard wiring for art isn't an option",1
"I bought this June 19th. It’s now August 16th. Does not work. Changed the batteries, nothing. $30 isn’t cheap when it’s just a piece of plastic hanging on your wall.",0
Looks very cheap. Definitely would not recommend,0
"the brightness is so low. i wanted a direct spot light on top my glitter wall art, so the glitters would sparkle but this spot light brightness is so low didn't make any difference. The pic shows at 100% brightness level set.",0
Horrible color. The stem is a nice good but the battery area and light is a cheap looking orange old plastic . Does not look like photos. Surprised no one has mentioned this,0
"This was a perfect solution to highlight a painting I have that does not get a lot of light. Easy to install and nice looking. Options for warm white light or white light and 50% or 100% intensity are also nice. Light angle is adjustable as well and the remote is perfect for a space that has no outlet. Casing is plastic and somewhat on the cheap side so I hope it lasts. One note that may be the fault of Amazon shipping and the USPS delivery person. I gave specific shipping instructions to leave at my door, with info on entering my gated property. The package was left outside my gate in the weather and it does not appear any attempt was made to deliver it to my door. I'm lucky it wasn't stolen.",1
Painting,1
"We wanted something classy but didn’t want to hardwire something into the wall. This fit the bill perfectly. Took two minutes to install, and works well. It’s adjustable for brightness and hue, with a timer. Love it so much, I just purchased another. It does have an orange tint to the plastic, but it’s not noticeable once installed.",1
New Batteries burnt out very fast.,0
Color is very orange,0
"What a piece of garbage, so many batteries later this does not work at all. Huge fail and disappointment. Of course it is past the return date. If I could give it zero stars I would.",0
Poor overall quality - light was extremely dim. Cheap plastic. AVOID!,0
Gold color is more orange. Not cute.,0
"The light works great, but the color is orange, not gold.",0
"It is not enough bright , light is medium goof for small frame",0
" This is my replacement order after receiving the first one which was clearly returned and the remote was not included. This was packaged in a smaller box which made me feel like it was new and not a return. Overall, glad they made it right but definitely a disappointment. There’s definitely a discrepancy in color, the “rose gold” is not it, but this works for what I want it for. If the little details like that will bother you don’t get this version, but overall I’m happier.

Update: Video added with remote control use. Light works for its purpose. Definitely not the prettiest thing but it’s cost effective. Not sure if I’d buy again but it works for now.",0
It makes picture stand out and look museum looking.,1
"Nice light, timer is a little short, we needed to keep resetting to keep on all evening.",1
Received this item after ordering another. Worked fine until we needed to replace the batteries in both the unit and remote. Now it will not light at all. The first light still works fine. Reluctant to order another.,0
Absolutely PERFECT! They make it easy to hang as well,1
Put this on a picture in our patio and it is beautiful at night. love the remote.,1
I like everything about the 4 I bought. My only dislike is the estimated 60 hours of battery life. But if you use the timer and the lights aren't on full bright who knows how long it will last. All in all I'm glad I bought them.,1
Very nice,1
As a beautiful addition to display my wall art.,1
Works well!,1
" I like that you can dim and change the brightness of the the lights. I like soft white and at 50% at night. The remotes work in this odd space by the stairs, I was was impressed they worked from the top of the stairs. I love this product. Sorry the video is so long, I recorded it for my sister to show her and couldn't trim to post here.",1
The light is easy to install and really beautiful. Just what I needed for the space,1
"I love the light—great for the price—however, the first remote did not work so I contacted the seller who promptly sent another. This remote does not work either!! The picture is high and I will need a ladder to turn on the light!! Very disappointed in the remote. I attempted to purchase another but can’t find how. I tried to re-contact the seller, but have not heard anything. If I can’t get a remote that works, the product is virtually useless!!",0
,1
"it really doesn't light up the picture, is just has a dim halo around the top. Good material and fitment but just not enough light",0
I loved this item.,1
"I added this light above a piece of wall art and it really ties it together. Love the gold, the remote control is easy and assembly is a breeze. There is a piece on the back that makes it so easy to install!",1
Did not have a convenient wall outlet. Remote control is good however not bright at all.,0
I love ALL the options for remote-clever design w timers and dimmers. I even love the easy installation with a little level on the back! Good value! So rare these days.,1
There was no problem installing it. And it works fine. But if you’re looking for something high end this isn’t it because the base and head are plastic. So only the arm is metal. So I am a little disappointed with the look overall.,0
Works great !!! Love it !!,1
I hate it. Not enough light remote is a joke. Only stays on for alittle while. I took it down. Would love to send it back!,0
"Tiene una iluminacion muy baja, la puse para resaltar un cuadro, y no funciono, ahora esta como puro adorno arriba del cuadro",0
Not bright,0
This was super easy to install and I love how it looks. The plate on the back has a self-leveling tool making it error proof for me. Popped in 3 AA batteries and it is up. Easy to take down to change batteries when needed. I like how you can set a timer with the remote. Highly recommend.,1
Liked everything about the light EXCEPT for the actual lighting aspect.,0
We bought this for one of my father in law's collections. He really likes it so far. It was easy to mount and the light is nice and bright.,1
Quit working after 3 months. I've replaced all batteries and it does not power on. Very disappointing.,0
Like the light...buttons on the remote are stiff to push....,0
"A much beloved heirloom Japanese scarf, having been framed, deserved a spotlight to really show it off. This is a great little light for the price, the remote is easy to use, and the battery life (depending on brightness setting) is very good. Installation was simple, and changing the batteries is fast and easy. Definitely recommend, and we're considering another light for another art piece.",1
"I saw this on a favorite YouTube channel of mine and decided to order it for some artwork. It looks really good and has a nice, modern look to it. I never keep it on unless I’m showing it to someone but I feel like the batter have really drained quickly, causing the light to be super dim on its higher level. Could just be the dollar store batteries though! That being said I already ordered a second one. Im happy with it and recommend it!",1
"Easy install, remote works great, wish have AC power input. Not bright enough as expected.",1
"La lampe n'est pas assez efficace, et le retour de la lampe chez le fournisseur nous coûte plus de 30% du coût d'achat. Donc pensez y bien sérieusement avant de faire une commande.",0
broke after a few weeks!!!,0
"Well made, good quality...remote is great also!",1
Purchased this picture light for a picture where there was no access to electricity. Worked fairly well for the first week or two but went through batteries very quickly. Then it simply stopped working. Changed the batteries in the light and the remote. Still nothing. Terrible product at a ridiculously high price.,0
"I was a little disappointed because it is mostly plastic, but I hung it. It looks nice high on the wall. I have only had it a couple of months, and it has already stopped working properly. The light is now very dim.",0
Not strong enough to illuminate a 36” painting.,0
Not bright enough.,0
"Easy to install and operate. It is pretty bright, but definitely could be brighter.
Would recommend if you don’t have an option for wired lamp.",1
Great,1
Everything about ordering and receiving the light was great. Installation was easy too. Because it's battery operated the light intensity is a bit weak but it works for now.,1
Just right,1
 A great little light to add accent to a hall way,1
Three new batteries and it won't turn on.,0
The product completely stopped working after 2 months. Batteries were fine. We did not even use it that much during that 2 months. Working on a refund somehow. Product should last longer.,0
"As you can see from their images, the light shines into the room, and a little on the picture. You can rotate the light, but then it’s illuminating the ceiling and the wall, and the picture. The problem is the light comes from 180 degrees, when it should come from 90 degrees to illuminate the picture only. It’s a bad design for a picture light.",0
"I wish the batteries lasted longer. It is very, very nice and glad to have it when I have company.",1
"I used my light over an antique painting. I like how you can change the light from a golden glow, to a cool blue. It is super-easy to install. The price point was good as well. I have purchased 3 of them. There were other reviews which stated that the gold color was more of a rose-gold. It is more of a bronze-gold color, but that goes really well with antique-gold picture frames. You can also adjust and angle the lights accordingly. They were very easy to install. All in all, a very good purchase.",1
"Works better than I expected.
Very happy with it.",1
"This works well and is what I needed. Color could be a bit better and brightness of light could be a bit brighter. But, for price and ease of install not bad at all.",1
"The light is a nice size, nice weight, looks nice. But it DOES NOT work. I went and bought a new battery for the remote and it still doesn’t work. I threw my packaging away so I can’t return it. wasted $30.00. It’s a nice concept, nice in theory but like I said mine just did not work!",0
Lighting a picture.,1
No dislikes to be honest. So far so good. Recommend. Use for my photographs. Love the timer and lighting options.,1
"I like the 15 min - 2.5 hr timer. I can just forget about it and not run down the batteries. I use rechargeables, and they seem to have a long run time.",1
Not using for picture but for a bathroom wall mirror I use when I need close up attention. Not bright enough for me.,0
"Quality very cheap. Should have sent it back, however just threw it away.",0
"Cute and affordable but looks cheap up close. I may spray paint it a softer gold in the future, but for now it serves its purpose. You get what you pay for so I am not too upset about it looking plastic-y and cheap. It works well but most importantly, it looks really sharp above a frame (from a distance Lol). Would still purchase again!",1
We’re disappointed that lighting is a lot weaker than what we expected.,0
"Perfect for hallway art lighting! It’s beautiful at night. Easy to install, handy remote. Inexpensive! Very attractive.",1
Bought this light to light up a 16x20 photo. It meets my expectations and beyond. Would highly recommend,1
"No need for cords, outlets, and the lighting options are endless! Coming back for more!",1
Looks great and does the job. My only complaint is that it burns up the batteries somewhat faster than I expected.,1
"These lights were just the look I was looking for. It is hard to mount them securely to the wall. The plastic is cheap, batteries are stuck and can't get the last one out to see if the battery is why they are not working. Way too expensive for the quality of the product. Didn't use the remote, easier to just turn it on and off. Worked for a short while and now can't get the battery out to see if that is the issue.",0
Doesn’t give off the quality light I was hoping for and looks super cheap.,0
"I love that came in one day, they are light weight and easy to install. They have settings for brightness and color tones.",1
A saw a review saying a flash light would be better and they were right! I returned all 4 that I bought.,0
Perfect lighting for my pictures.,1
Exactly what I ordered. Easy install.,1
"I was thinking that this would be a much brighter light. But I think this is to be expected because it is battery powered. It does eat batteries faster than I expected. Also, although you have guides to align the screws when installing, I did this all correctly, when I put the light in the wall bracket, the light fixture was crooked. Not much you can do to straighten it. I used a little shim on one side. But for the money, it is a nice little light. I like the remote box, I set the timer for 2 hours. this preserves the batteries a bit. Has three different tones of light. Nice feature.",0
"This item was built well, not something I say often. It is easily setup, mounted and includes a mounting template making it even easier to place it on the wall. The quality of light (throw and lumen) is excellent and the options range from warm lighting to cool lighting with a built-in dimmer that allows you to set the mood for the artwork being illuminated. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1
"This is made of plastic and totally cheap. It might look great from afar but is really cheap. And it is a nightmare to install as it will not stay flush against the wall and keeps tilting over. I give it two stars because of the dimmer and all. Very disappointing. You buy cheap stuff, you get cheap stuff.",0
Installed this light over my desk. It is perfect! It even has different settings.,1
"I’m actually very pleased with this product! It is actually better than my expectations!
Easy installation! Amazing result!
I will definitely buy more of these!!!",1
So easy to install and they compliment my office bookcases beautifully,1
"Brightness doesn’t last and wasn’t very bright to begin with, even at 100%. Disappointed in my purchase.",0
Perfect for our new picture. Lights up with remote. Great quality. Looks like a gallery print now.,1
We now have three of them lighting framed pictures. Same remote works for all three.,1
,1
battery life short... very very pretty looks like real brass its plastic,1
I DISLIKE NOTHING ABOUT THIS ITEM. IT IS MORE THAN I EXPECTED. LOVE IT,1
We wanted a light for a painting in our living room snd found this light. It is battery operated with a remote control so eliminates an ugly cord hanging on the wall. The dimmer feature and color of the light are what sold us and it is a great way to accent any picture or painting.1,1
Only had this for a few months- hardly used- and not left on for long. Have needed to change batteries 2x and now has completely stopped working.,0
Love the remote different degrees of light would buy again!,1
We were nervous about the metal/plastic combo this light had when we ordered and YUP: it's awful. The plastic bits (everything but the curved piece) are VERY orange compared to the yellow gold of the metal piece. We're returning this item immediately; never even tried installing because they look so bad. Great concept; terrible execution.,0
Works fine and looks good. but not outstanding quality. If only metal...would have beengreat,0
Wish the batteries would last longer. If you use this everyday you will have to change the batteries every week.,1
Not bright at all.,0
"Everything about this product has been great except for the brightness levels. When the lights are at 100% they’re fine but when I dim the lights, either manually or by pressing the preset “50%” button they change back to 100% after about a minute or so. They will dim perfectly whether I use the remote or the side button on the lights themselves but they will always change back to 100% when I would like to keep them dimmed for a while. Anyone else having this problem?! Or is it the way the product is designed?",1
Good to install,1
"This was a gift for someone who likes my 'electric picture light'. This was a major upgrade from mine. It has a remote control, is battery operated & is LED. Guess 20 years makes a lot of improvements:-)",1
"I have a very long canvas print. I just assumed that the light would hit the entire canvas. I realize this model of light does not have the flexibility acceptable to be able to have it shine on the total of the picture. I will need to buy some ceiling Mounted lights instead.
This would be perfect for a smaller print",0
"Purchased this due to price, good reviews and an influencer I follow:/ I was so disappointed when I opened it, so so cheap looking. Like painted plastic. Seemed to work fine and for 30$ what ya expect. Returned.",0
Junk. Absolute junk.,0
These are great. I wish they came in a more aged gold color but the yellow gold works fine. The remote doesn’t work from far away which sucks but overall we are happy with them.,1
"Great
Product and VERY reasonable priced. Shows off the artwork in fantastic light! Different choices of shades and all done with a remote; no standing on chairs/ladders to turn on/off!",1
It's only lighting up less than half of my map. That's at full brightness.,0
Has 3 settings for the lights and displays beautifully!,1
 Me encanto,1
This is barely a light. They are the worst. The material sucks. You can barely see anything with they. You can see better with a flashlight from your phone.,0
"Looks great! Turned my art work into a priceless piece of art! The lighting is Amazing! Wish I could have this kind of lighting over my head all the time...lol! Draws everyones attention to the painting, when I have the light on. I like the looks of the light and makes my living room a classy room. A great purchase!",1
I had previously spent a fortune trying to hardwire picture frame lights around my home and could never get them in the correct place and if I later changed the size of frame it would come out wrong. This is a great product! I would highly recommend.,1
Works great!,1
"In the picture the gold colour of the metal and plastic( it’s all plastic except for the bar) are the same...in fact, only the metal bar is the same colour as the advertised item...the plastic is very bright old gold. I am luck that my picture frame can handle this colour above it....it would absolutely not work with a more modern frame or setting.The item is very cheap...the plastic got scratched as I was installing it. I am keeping it because it serves my immediate purpose, but I would certainly not recommend it.",0
A little more bronze than gold but still looks and works great!,1
We hung the light over a picture in a dark corner.,1
"It’s a nice lamp but for my mom who I bought it for, wasn’t able to manage remote control. Wish they had power to it/ plug in. Goes through batteries too fast if they want light on all the time but good for average person. Very elegant lamp.",1
Love these....battery operated but SO nice not to see electrical cords hanging down the wall. I bought three.,1
It’s so pretty and it’s not heavy it’s easy to install just the perfect touch,1
"There are far too many Chinese cheap products that come up under a search for this type of light, so let me make this simple: this is the one you want. See my photo; this is a 27x41” poster, as I know there are different sizes.
The plate mounts to the wall, even has a tiny level in it so you can’t screw it up, and the light slides over the plate. Excellent quality; three types of illumination; adjustable; has remote…what else can you ask for?",1
"This light is perfect for pictures. It looks great, the remote is easy to utilize and I will be purchasing again for other projects I'll be doing in our home.",1
"I love this lamp! Yes, the gold color is more like a bronze gold, but it looks so good! Easy installation and I really like that you can choose between warm or cold light.",1
Like the light...buttons on the remote are stiff to push....,0
The batteries need replacement in two weeks. Only put on lights a few hours a night. Not happy with this and we have three.,0
"First of all, if you are looking to light up a super expensive piece of art I would assume you are not looking to buy this light. However, I purchased this light because i do have several pieces of art that are moderately expensive and my house has terrible lighting to say the least. I bought one light to see how well it works and i will be buying more for my other paintings. It is rather inexpensive and easy to install. It does a good job lighting up my art but again is not a professional light. There are 2 light modes but i prefer the white light and the remote is super helpful as i installed this high enough i would need a ladder to turn it on and off. Another really great thing is that you can set a timer on the remote so that the light auto turns off so you do not burn through batteries. I recommend this product and will be buying more.",1
Perfect to highlight an antique photo of my grandfather.,1
"I love this light. While it is not the brightest picture light you could buy, I think it’s perfect for my needs. It is really attractive and the installation was so easy. It comes with a tiny level built in so that you know that you are hanging it straight. I love it!",1
The only reason I bought them was because it has dimmable setting... however the light resets itself to maximum brightness in less than 30 minutes,0
Everything was as expected. Very happy with the purchase!,1
"Great in my lounge
Great for when the power goes out
I love the way you don’t have lamps around for little hands .
Love the way it looks
Puts out great amount of light",1
Great product for the price and looks and works mounted a very costly oil painting. It was easy to install and is the perfect size. The remote is an excellent accessory and the brightness choices are perfect.,1
"It worked great for 4-5 days! After you throw out the box, it gets SOOO Dim! I bought 2 - both are terrible ! Don’t waste your money!!!",0
Product is great looking BUT EATS BATTERIES SO WAY TOO FAST. I installed Lithium Energizers like I use in my Blink devices thinking they would last 3-6 months - WRONG - I turn this light on 2-4 hours a night and it completely depletes the batteries within 1 week!!! So total runtime is about 10-14 hours - this is a dealbreaker for me - I will Keep the one I opened BUT RETURNING the other TWO.,0
Whoever came up with this idea was the genius,1
"I like it a lot, purchased several ones for all my pictures",1
"It does not hold its charge for very long. Maybe an hour. Then starts to die out for last 10min by getting dimmer and dimmer till off. . Then takes long time to recharge again. I would not invest if you are going to use it more than hour Easy to install, nice looking",0
"In the picture the gold colour of the metal and plastic( it’s all plastic except for the bar) are the same...in fact, only the metal bar is the same colour as the advertised item...the plastic is very bright old gold. I am luck that my picture frame can handle this colour above it....it would absolutely not work with a more modern frame or setting.The item is very cheap...the plastic got scratched as I was installing it. I am keeping it because it serves my immediate purpose, but I would certainly not recommend it.",0
Excellent product!,1
"Luxway picture light, remote does not work, very disappointing, the time I have tried new batterys and try to fix it is crazy, please send me a new remote that works. Thank you Terry Todd",0
"Super easy to install, brightness is great and I love that you can adjust the warmth of the light. I spray painted them because the gold finish as it came was pretty terrible. The only downside is that you have to have the remote within inches of the light for it to work, but that isn’t a huge deal for me. Great light!",1
Love this product. It arrived exactly like the photos. Was very easy to install. Takes 3 AAA Batteries. The remote requires a button battery. (just saying that for those who don't. like keeping button batteries in their homes with kids),1
"With limited placement options, there is a strong lighting glare for paintings under glass, and I would not recommend this item for those uses.",0
Great light. Looks really expensive. I want to buy more.,1
"In the picture the gold colour of the metal and plastic( it’s all plastic except for the bar) are the same...in fact, only the metal bar is the same colour as the advertised item...the plastic is very bright old gold. I am luck that my picture frame can handle this colour above it....it would absolutely not work with a more modern frame or setting.The item is very cheap...the plastic got scratched as I was installing it. I am keeping it because it serves my immediate purpose, but I would certainly not recommend it.",0
Absolutely junk !! Worked for around 3-4 months then won’t turn on...no customer service would like a replacement ...,0
"Very disappointed. Purchased this light knowing that it could be a ""you get what you pay for"" situation and it certainly was. Light was dim after Day #4. And I only had the light on for maybe 2 hours a day if that. Completely drained many batteries. Very cheap material, although from a distance it looks nice. Would have kept it if it wasn't running through batteries and if the light that it produced was sufficient to highlight my art. Off to buy something more substantial.",0
 I used it to help elevate my mirrors on my wall and it did what needed to be done!,1
This light is super cool. Remote control definitely a bonus,1
Definitely a great buy! Easy to install and looks good with no wires hanging down.,1
Colour of the actual light is awful. The light and the base are almost orange and the neck is gold.,0
It requires frequent battery changes. Very inconvenient.,0
,1
"Batteries go here to die, so you would think at least there would be a reasonably significant amount of light produced. It's nice to look at, easy to install, but the function part of the product name is LIGHT. If you miss that goal, the rest is just window dressing.",0
"The batteries don't last, the light isn't bright. CHanging batteries don't work. this is a plastic piece of wasted $$ DON'T BUY!!!!!",0
I liked the looks and color but now what do I do with the burned out section,0
This picture light works perfectly for us. We like it so well that we ordered and are using four more!,1
"The light has stopped working after not being installed for too long and rarely ever being on. Not sure if it’s the batteries, but they were new. Still investigating. Looks good over my commissioned hand-tooled leather art though. I was able to attach it to the wall with 3M Velcro strips, but it seems a bit heavy to not use wall screws. Hasn’t fallen yet, and it’s been up there on Velcro for almost 3 months.",0
No remote,0
"The fixture looks great, I read in several reviews that the fixture had a orange hue but I'm guessing they have improved and fixed that problem bc the fixture looks gold as shown in the picture.",1
I pulled off the tab on the remote as instructed. Remote never worked. Wish I had tried it before installing. I'd return if I still had packaging. Not happy!,0
"This is so much nicer than I thought it would be, and at a terrific price. Installation was a snap. I bought two and will definitely get more. This is a really great cordless solution for smart looks and occasional use.",1
Easy to install. Looks great.,1
Worked great and looked great. Much easier then having to hardwire etc...,1
"Light span is no more than 15"" from light.",0
" Easy to install, great addition",1
Love it,1
ONLY OPERATES WITH BATTERIES AND WILL LAST A FEW HRS TURNED ON,0
Piece of garbage! Save your money! Did not come with a remote control. Absolutely useless. Unable to reach the seller,0
Does the job designed to do....,1
"Stating that the package is 17"" is deceptive as the lit lengths consist of only two separate 4"" sections",0
It looks great hopefully won’t die on me,1
"This light is cheap, so you get what you pay for. I can’t get it to hold tightly to the wall, so had to use double-sided tape to keep it flush to the wall. The light arm is also just a tad crooked, and you can’t adjust that part. We will see how fast it goes through batteries.",0
I liked the looks and color but now what do I do with the burned out section,0
It’s exactly what needed to light a painting,1
"Love this light! Easy to hang, as it has a built in level. This was PERFECT!",1
"I wish the light was a little adjustable, my pic is tall and the light does not alume the entire picture.",1
"I needed a light for a tintype photo that was too dark and this is perfect. It was very easy to install except I ended up using nails with a larger head as I did not have the ability to use the enclosed screws. I love that the light heads can be rotated to the exact position you need as well as the fact that there are 3 different choices for lighting (6 white LED lights, 6 warm white LED lights or the combination of 12) and that there is a remote control! Also, the color is fine. It is described as orangey (which it is not) and someone else had said a brushed gold would be preferrable (which it is).",1
"Maybe you'll luck out and get a good one. Mine changed it's brightness all on it's own and unless you have the controller in your hand, it isn't supposed to do that.",0
"It isn't very bright. If you want to illuminate a diploma, it would be great. No good for normal size paintings. I will eventually find a use for it, but not for the art quilt I was hoping to illuminate.",0
Light did not work after third time it was turned on.,0
I love it! Very elegant! It is dimmable. Only downfall is that it requires batteries. The other one I have allows you to pull it off and charge.. but that is the only complaint. It’s perfect for my entryway,1
Great product,1
"Easy to install, control… looks great above the bar",1
I use this to add additional light to my glow in the dark papyrus print I brought back from Egypt. It works well however I wish it was brighter and that the stem was flexible.,1
"When you are unable to contact the seller, this is not good. I’m surprised Amazon allows this. I have several of these small remotes in my home and sell items that also use them. Not once have I ever had such a problem trying to replace the battery in the remote. It literally got destroyed. Since I am unable to contact the seller, I will replace the entire item. I refuse to give company my money if they are an untouchable.",0
"Remote stopped working within 30 days. Purchased new battery for remote...still not working. This picture light is now, useless!",0
Looks great over my picture---really like the remote---easy to install!!!!,1
"La lampe n'est pas assez efficace, et le retour de la lampe chez le fournisseur nous coûte plus de 30% du coût d'achat. Donc pensez y bien sérieusement avant de faire une commande.",0
Works beautifully and has a few different settings for the light control - exceptionally pleased.,1
"Disappointed, UPS left out in rain. No idea if they work. They do look nice",0
"Light is excellent and really shows off the art work.
Battery operated with remote control makes it very easy.",1
Great lighting solution for pictures in hallway,1
"My office is a box with no windows. Thanks to this product, I'm able to have 2 more alternative forms of light highlighting the art I pretty much can never see without migrane-inducing, godless flourescent lighting! Thanks LUXSWAY and Amazon!!",1
"Easy mounting, but for my larger frame the light only illuminated the top 6-10 inch.",1
"For $68 it is not worth it. The light colour are warm or bright with timers, that’s nice but that’s about it. The “gold” light has a traditional gold neck but the two end pieces are more rose gold, fake plastic which I’ve tried to capture in the photos. I talked to “influencers” who bought this in USA and theirs is much better and for $25. If you’re in Canada do not buy this product unless you’re desperate and maybe buying black as it’ll probably be all the same shade. Definitely going to return, sadly.",0
"Not happy with this light. As you can see it only lit up the very top of my painting. The lamp below gave it most of the lighting. This painting is 30"" x 40"" so maybe I should have used two lights but that wouldn't look very good to have two lights. I guess this light would only be good for a small painting. Very small. The remote and easy to install was good but that's about all.",0
Nice lamp for our dart board...love the timer off option just wish it stayed brighter longer. Going thru batteries like hotcakes.,1
Great product and easy installation! Looks great and works like a charm! Highly recommend!!!,1
,1
THis light works pretty good but the batteries drain very fast. Wouldn't recommend buying it.,0

"This is an elegantly designed light with well thought out features for varying light temperature and brightness. The remote functions including a timer which is a particularly good idea for a battery-powered light. But the light is not very bright so it was not at all suitable for the 36"" x 24"" picture for which it was purchased. It would be very good for up to about 11"" x 14"". the design is minimalist which keeps it unobtrusive and not distracting from the item illuminated but the result is that there is no shade over the light to keep all the light on the picture and prevent the lighted LEDs being seen directly by the viewer.",1
Used on a large painting so it is not that bright but would be perfect for something smaller.,1
Works great,1
"Remote was easy enough but brightness just isn’t enough for the painting only luminates
The top 1/4 of picture",0
you have to take the whole thing down to get to the battery compartment,0
" Perfect! Exactly as pictured! The dimmer is a amazing feature and the remote works from a good amount of distance. It's perfect in the morning when you are half awake and don't want a bright light, but just enough to see especially since I have blackout curtains. The transition of the dimmer doesn't show as well in the video, but it is very smooth. The hanging process was so quick and easy! The back plate has a built in level which allowed me to hang it perfectly straight and in just minutes. It comes with everything you need in order to hang. My last 2 pics shows the different hues, the 1st being the warm setting and the 2nd being the cool setting. I Love it!",1
It looks nice but it's not bright enough.,0
Exactly as expected. Will order more!,1
"We love this light w no cords hanging
Remote control so good
Looks wonderful over art work
Fit our painting perfectly
I would order another one!",1
 I really like this light and it’s function but unfortunately mine gave out after only a month. I’m hoping the replacement doesn’t do the same cause I like the way it lights up the artwork.,1
" What an affordable way to elevate the look of your home! Easy to install, remote is small and discreet, with a timer",1
"Absolutely love these lights, used them over my Goblet paintings, it makes them look amazing at night. The fact I can adjust the brightness and set the timer is amazing! Will be buying more to add to my living room and study",1
Easy to install; lightweight enough for command strips ; completed overall project look,1
Excellent light. Gives a good glow and lights the pics up very nicely! Not sure how long the battery lasts but it has been 2 weeks and it is still working! Plus it has a remote control and it can switch off after 2 hours! Highly recommend this when you don’t want to hard wire.,1
"This item is advertised as replaceable batteries, but in fact the opposite. Once first set of batteries run out. The lights are no longer operational. We tried everything. Replaced batteries in the lights and in remote control. Still nothing. So dissatisfied",0
Overall lived it but the color looked cheap so had to return it.,0
"Very pleased with this product, love the look, especially the level to assist with the ease with f
Installations",1
"Tiene una iluminacion muy baja, la puse para resaltar un cuadro, y no funciono, ahora esta como puro adorno arriba del cuadro",0
"Do NOT buy this product!!! I just paid $13 to
return a defective product because it had been on my wall 3 weeks!
Lights go dim then stop working!!!",0
"Looks great
Installed easily
Has multiple settings.",1
"Great little light! Super easy to install and was impressed with the built in level on the hanging bracket. I’ve only had it for a day so
I can’t speak to longevity, but so far it works great. Awesome purchase for the price.",1
I like the look of the light and overall easy to install and looks really nice. Also it is a bonus having both LED and an alternative soft light look (almost incandescent). There is some flexibility in adjusting the light itself but the one thing that would have improved this light is a longer flexible arm. I find the light does not really illuminate well the lower half of my painting and a flexible arm could have solved this problem.,1
"Like several have written here, this product failed after very little use. I only turned it on infrequently. I changed batteries in both the light and the remote but it no longer functions. Very disappointed in this Amazon Choice product.",0
"I have metal ones in my living room and they work great but were expensive and difficult to install. This one is made of mostly plastic but you almost can’t tell. You would have to get up close and even then it is difficult. I just installed it so I can’t say how long the batteries last. But I don’t intend to keep it on constantly as I don’t the metals one. The remote is great; allows you to turn on/off; dim; timer and change type of lighting. For the price, this one can’t be beat!",1
,1
"I kept it to avoid the hassle, but would never order it again. When it is installed, the neck is too short and it shines brightly on the top side of the frame, but no matter how it is adjusted, it cannot shine on more than the upper half of the painting leaving the bottom half in darkness. The level that is attached to the plate you use for the installation is not level. There is nothing adjustable about it with the arm having no flexibility except side to side. As I said, don't waste your time!",0
This was easy to install & looks amazing. I love that it’s battery operated so I didn’t have to hook anything up. It’s also a great price comparatively.,1
"I really like the way this ended up looking, and it would be perfect if not for the fact that the timer doesn't work daily. Yes I can turn it on with the remote, and choose how long it will stay on for. However it will not turn itself back on the next day. I have a ton of flameless candles and other lighting things in my room that exist on timers 6 hours on 18 hours off. I wish this did the same thing. I would have considered returning it if it wasn't drilled into my wall.",0
Orange Copper color .Not gold. Hideous . Not at all as described,0
Does not work well with glass in a frame because the light reflects in the glass.,1
It’s ok but batteries run out soon so it gets dim after a few hours.,0
"This is a first time for us illuminating original art. The lamps work beautifully, they are easy to adjust
We highly recommend this product",1
This is a super easy install and adds a lot to the picture. Highly recommended.,1
"Tiene una iluminacion muy baja, la puse para resaltar un cuadro, y no funciono, ahora esta como puro adorno arriba del cuadro",0
Control remoto,0
"The lights bounce back off the glass of the painting causing a glare on the glass. Wanted to return, but I missed the date by 3 days. I would suggest getting a non-LED light, which I had before and was better.",0
"This light barely worked at all. There was very little light from it even before it completely gave up working, and the remote was hit or miss. Very disappointed with this purchase.",0
This was my 3rd set of lights and the first that was super easy to install! Just what I was looking for.,1
Muy fácil de instalar y muy práctico,1
Cant really use it. Its just too dim.,0
"I get compliments on mine. I’ve now bought three. Kinda cool how you can position lights, choose bright or warm and there is a tiny level bubble in the back sleeve for easy install. If there’s a drawback it’s that it’s light weight plastic but for the price..that’s okay. You can’t tell by a glance",1
We are very pleased with our purchase. They illuminate two favorite wall hangings in our home.,1
it is the perfect size and was extremely easy to install. My only negative was I wish it was a little bit brighter. Overall it's an outstanding product.,1
Magnifica !,1
"One of my lights came bent....total bummer. Other than that, they are nice!",0
The light is very low even on brightest setting. The batteries die in this very rapid. Can’t afford to replace them 2/3 times a month. I had a different brand several years ago that I only changed batteries in once a year.,0
Excellent like at a showroom,1
Everything was adjustable so you could get the light just so!,1
This light is perfect for my painting. The painting is located in a spot that doesn't have much light and this makes all the difference in the world. Very happy that I found this at a reasonable price.,1
Love it!,1
Love this item. Purchased this for my parents painting. I purchased the gold because their frame is the same color and texture. The light has a ton of options from the remote!,1
Light doesn’t last after 3 weeks is very low it’s not good,0
Christmas present that only worked a few times... changed battery and still not working.,0
"At first I wasn't fond of the orange gold but when I put them up, it looked amazing! There are several different light settings as well. And I can use one remote for both lights. Very reasonably priced as well.",1
Oil painting illumination. Works perfectly.,1
This changed the game for highlighting a painting in my hallway and especially love the timer function (though I wish there was more than 2-hour option). Also easy to change the battery. Make your place look fancy like an art gallery!,1
"Easy to install, looked nice and lite the picture perfect. Lasted a month. Changed batteries and nothing. Bought 2 and same happened with black one. Very disappointed in the product.",0
The paint look so different now ..in love!!,1
the lights are very dim at best- the remotes controls worked at first but do not do anything- it is to late to return these as they go bad and stop working after the time allowed to return these is reached. I would not buy or recommend these to anyone. sorry I purchased these,0
Just arrived and will use for wall art and instructions seem clear and easy.,1
"Easy to install, just the right light. Love love love it. Makes the print look elegant, I think.",1
That’s the review.,0
Just perfect over one of my favorite oils. It looks expensive but it’s not!!!,1
" I literally love everything about this. I can’t stand bright white light. The control let’s you use warm light, gives a dimmer option as well as a timer option. If you use the button on the light itself, it gives you a “mixed” option which is shown in my photo and video. It’s also incredibly easy to install. There is a level (the measuring stick with the leveling bubble) that makes installing as easy as can be. I loved it so much I bought another, then my parents saw it and had me purchase several for them as well. My dad is an artist and very particular with the artwork he has on display. If you have a large painting I would use 2, but it’s perfect for what I have. Also, bonus, one remote works for all of them so you can keep one for backup if you have several in the same room like I do.",1
I was very pleased with this product. Worked great and having 3 different color lights really show off my picture!,1
So easy to put up. They add so much flare to my wall space and it was exactly what I needed.,1
I bought this for a 32x48 and it is definitely not bright enough. The LED's used are on the cheap end so not worth $40 because its all plastic and probably made for $2 in China.,1
I liked the looks and color but now what do I do with the burned out section,0
I like the timer and the fact it will turn off by its self. I also like the way you can set it to daylight and also sunset.,1
Very easy to install works great love how easy it will be to replace batteries.,1
Muy practico su uso e instalacion,1
The product looked very cheap when I unpacked it and so I had to return,0
"Best product ever. Batteries last a long time and I have bought several and plan to buy more. Super easy to install, love the built in level! Superior product and I rarely give reviews. Highly recommend this product. Makes any artwork seem like it’s from the Louvre!",1
Onky good for small paintings. Made of plsstic...should have known for the price.,0
This was exactly what I was looking for to help showcase some of my husband sports memorabilia.,1
The light is lit by four D batteries and we have it on in the hall day and evening. A great product.,1
"I really like the look of it and it's a great value option for the others that retail double or more than double the price.
Most of the lamp is plastic but it is hard to tell once you have it installed which took me less than 3 minutes to set up.
My only complaint is that I would like for the yellow light to be more warm but I believe that is personal preference.",1
Made in China,0
The design is fine and the installation was easy. I intend to buy more.,1
I was looking for something easy to install but cute and with excellent quality and I found it! I Highly recommend it!,1
The brass color was not brass. It looks terribly cheap!,0
"Very happy with this purchase. I knew going into it this was not a high quality light for a painting, but I needed something inexpensive for now and this does the trick! To be honest, I was lazy and did not have the tools to actually mount it on to the painting , so I simply laid it over the top and it anchored itself quite nicely over the back, and being so lightweight it worked out perfectly! Now I only did this because it’s a temporary fix until I get the tool to mount it properly, and because of this it doesn’t distribute the light as evenly as it will when it’s mounted to the frame. However, I’m impressed with how well it works, and the remote is great, you control everything , dimmer, timer, warm light/ cool light from the remote that seems to have about a10 ft range. Up close it’s a little cheap looking as some reviews have stated, but once it’s mounted on the frame it looks just fine. My brother was so impressed he also bought one. I highly recommend 😁",1
Love all the buttons and options.,1
I really liked these lights but be warned they only last a few months. After 2 battery cycles the lights die out and will not turn on with fresh batteries. I’ve purchased 3 of these so far and cannot justify another one. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.,0
Easy to install and nice looking but the light itself is basically useless. I turned all the lamps off in the room and on the brightest setting I could barely tell there was any light coming from the lamp. Disappointed as for $25 I would at least like something that highlights the art.,0
"I ordered this light to go over a frame that has a gold edge around the matting, however the only part that was gold on this light was the pivot arm. The majority of the light fixture is actually copper in color, which won’t work with my frame so I am returning the light.
I did like the concept of being able to choose warm or cool lighting for my picture and also being able to pivot the aim of the light but the light is not bright enough for the color tone to matter. It only lit the very top part of the picture.
Another thing I discovered is that the majority of this light is plastic. I thought when the description said metal and plastic, that the lens over the led bulbs would be plastic and the rest would be metal when in fact the only part that is metal is the gold pivot arm. All other parts are plastic. Even with its shortcomings, I might have kept the light had it actually been entirely gold as stated in the description. Shiny copper with a small section of gold did not look right together in the light and looked even worse when I put it above the frame that also had gold accents. Very disappointed!",0
I ordered this light on Aug 29th. Loved it at first. I don’t turn it on daily. And when I do turn it on I only have it on for 60-120 mins. The light no longer turns on. I have switched out the batteries and even tried using the side button on the light instead of the remote and it still isn’t working.,0
Luv this picture light. There are 2 different settings for light soft or bright and the remote has a timer with 3 settings you can also turn light on manually if you choose. Great light for the price. Slim unit very nice looking.,1
This light is not gold. It is metallic burnt orange. Returning.,0
Great light a little challenge to hang up but built in level helps. Only complaint is the lack of communication with seller if your light comes broken just send back and reorder seller does not respond to you.,1
Loose connection on switch. Very dull. Returned,0
"La lampe n'est pas assez efficace, et le retour de la lampe chez le fournisseur nous coûte plus de 30% du coût d'achat. Donc pensez y bien sérieusement avant de faire une commande.",0
Poor light strength and curve not deep enough to get around a larger frame. Puts light to close to artwork. Not tecommended.,0
"Looks cheap but does the job and has a couple nice lighting options, both the warm and the cold tone.",0
"Not bright at all,I returned it",0
Value,1
Easy installation. awesome product,1
Installing this was pointless. The light isnt bright at all. Does nothing.,0
 I like that its wireless. I wish I could buy more than one that could be combined with one remote. I forgot and left it on over night with brand new batteries and they died. Over all I would buy again.,1
"I wanted to love this and thought it would look good from afar, but it is just too cheap looking. I was going to use command strips to attach to the wall. It’s very light. I even spray painted it gold so it had a uniform look because like other reviews, it is two toned gold. Part plastic/part metal.",0
"Very easy to install. Looks nice. Covers a large area of pictures!
Timer is nice it has several times to choose from.",1
"Easy to install, provide good light and for the price are an awesome deal!! My only complaint is that they are t gold or brass colored. They were pretty orange like a bad copper color. We spray painted them though and now they are perfect",1
Looks good easy installation easy use,1
Everything was just as decride,1
"This has something wrong with it; it's like it keeps drawing battery power even though it is turned off. It constantly needs new batteries (I quit using it because of this). The remote battery quit within 3 weeks of purchase too. The arm is not long enough, so when it did work, the light did not shine directly onto the item I was trying to illuminate. I wasted my money on this.",0
" So this picture light is beautiful. I bought 3 of them and one of the 3 didn’t work, so a new one was sent to me and it actually worked this time around. Beautiful lights with different settings. I love it",1
"Pros: Comes with a remote
-has multiple lighting options
-very clean look, looks great above my picture.
-they give you a paper diagram for screw placement, very helpful.
-cordless.

Cons: goes through batteries fast, I leave it on for about 4-5 hours a night and batteries died in about a week, I have mine up really high cause I have vaulted ceilings so its a pain.

Overall: I am happy with this purchase and I am looking at getting more for some other pictures.
I would recommend this product.",0
Easy to install on wall due to little bubble level attached to the back. Brightens my painting in a dark corner in living room.,1
They last a couple of days,0
Love this light!!!! Second time purchasing!!! Works great and the dimming feature is fabulous!!,1
Excellent,1
 Easy to install... I used 3m double sided tape & that did the trick. It really makes the painting pop. Very happy with it !!,1
Great,1
"I bought this light to light up my mother's funeral portrait. I've turned it on less than 10x and I recently tried turning it on and nothing, changed the remote battery and nothing. Sadly now I need to buy another one from another maker since my mom's death memoria6is coming up soon.",0
Perfect! My only complaint is that it’s slightly more orange/copper then gold but otherwise it’s perfect and worth the money. The remote has a time which is amazing and the light can be dimmed as well. There are three different light color options.,1
"Play Video
 It definitely makes my living room feel more luxurious!!! I love it",1
"Love it. Easy to install. We’ll see how long the batteries last, but so far it is just what I was looking for in a wireless solution.",1
"This is so much nicer than I thought it would be, and at a terrific price. Installation was a snap. I bought one and will definitely get more. This is a really great cordless solution for smart looks and occasional use.",1
The best part is the remote! My husband bought this to light up a painting we hung on a wall. We were looking for something like this forever at other hardware stores and couldnt find it but here! Great produt. Thanks Amazon!,1
Perfect for my art pieces!,1
"Is not like the picture; is not good sinking of orange plastic.
The light os also not good. Don’t worth the money.",0
"Battery dies quickly, not very bright.",0
"This has exceeded my expectations! Gold is a little brassy gold but not terrible and goes with the gold accents in my home. I am just laughing so hard at this! Plus, the back plate slides off so you can easily install and not have to fight lining up the holes. A+",1
Pour une peinture,1
I did need bigger screws to get the mount to stay. The light is top heavy. Looks great & easy to install.,1
"Easy to install, added great light and priced fair",1
Took me 10 minutes or less to install and another few minutes to adjust light perfectly. It has a built in level for easy installation.,1
Love the options for type light. Can be soft white or daylight. Wonderful flexibility.,1
They aren't very bright and they are cheaply made. I sent the ones I ordered back and found a desk lamp that was much brighter and fit my needs much better.,0
I love the light. My Dad had this desert landscape in his family for more than 70 years. It came a really ugly frame. Updated the frame and added the light. Love it now.,1
After I bought first one I was so pleased that I bought two more! Easy install and looks really nice! Brightens up art in dim areas of room and really gives it a professionally decorated feel!,1
Works as advertised,1
"I want to brighten up a small, beautiful but dark tapestry. This fixture did not provide sufficient light. Didn't return it as it may do the job for a different artwork.",0
Light is not powerful at all and it arrived defective. The arm was attached backwards and there is no way to turn it around. No good,0
Just had a vacation picture enlarged on a 30 x 40 canvas. This light adds just the right touch.,1
Love this light! Super easy to install and operate. Adds the perfect touch to display any artwork. Highly recommend!,1
I am in love with this light. Has so many different features including a timer. Can’t go wrong. Add it to your cart and enjoy. Blessings,1
I selected the gold color. Very elegant and lights up my painting perfectly. I really like the multiple choices in lights and the way the arm swivels. I am going to purchase more for the rest of my paintings. Highly recommend this product.,1
"I had moved into a new house and had my decorator come in and do my foyer before our housewarming party. We chose these pictures, but she said we needed a class of elegance to the farmhouse look, and she installed these two “museum art lights”. I figured out afterwards that you can change the temperature. I usually keep them on 50% warm and 50% cool color. Sometimes I choose warm, and sometimes I choose cool, it depends on how I feel at the time. I put pictures of both to show you the difference.",1
"This product was missing inside the box

Please send me the item!",1
Not bright at all,0
Honestly great customer service and solved my issue. Highly recommend them!,1
"I went for the cheaper version of this type of art light and it was the perfect choice. The remote is easy to use and the install is even easier. The timer is a great feature as well as the white and warm light settings.
Excellent buy for cost.",1
nice,1
The finish on the arm and the light are different… a LOT different. I missed the window to return / exchange bc I waited to open. Very disappointed.,0
"I like it has a remote, Bright light, low light. Easy to install light weight. I recommend buying this light. It’s not just for lighting a painting. You might just need brightness in a small space.",1
Bought 2…one for me and one for a client. Works great so far….easy to install. Has a mini level on the back plate.,0
LOOKS GREAT,1
"These are very nice lights. Regarding the color, they are gold, gold like a gold plate charger; however, when the light is on, they take on a even golder display more like the gold handle. For the price of these lights, my art displays look very nice.",1
i bought this because i didn’t want to spend a lot of money at RH when it got here its in pretty brand new condition but the remote control broke away. Seller replaced asap week later a brand new remote control is not working again i give up!,0
Very nice.,1
Looks good and very easy to install but it didn’t last very long,0
Was easy to install and works well. It has a battery life of 12 hrs. Rechargeable.,1
"I order two lights and just put them up , why are the lights different colors one is white and one is yellow. So upset",0
"I had a tiny bit of trouble thinking I could use command strips or smaller thumbtacks instead of the included screws. Just use the screws. The lighting has a warm or white setting, as well as different length timers. You'll need 3 AA batteries for the unit. The remote control came with a coin battery already in it. I was using some cheap plastic thing that went off every few minutes before, and now this looks like a nice upgrade.
Now if I can just upgrade my darn carpet to hardwoods, it'll look really nice upstairs ; )",1
Like other reviews have said this thing definitely drains your batteries in a matter of a few days. Not worth it unless maybe you have rechargeable batteries .Even then it would get annoying changing them all the time.,0
Its very subtle and attractive. Easy easy to prepare and install. I wish it was a little brighter.. but otherwise i love it! The remote has so many options!,1
"Eats batteries, pain to replace. Looks good!",0
I used 3m command strips and stuck these on top of ikea billy bookcases. It looks so fancy. But when you turn them on they are LED which always sorta reminds me of a bug zapper.,1
Light is not as bright,0
" These picture lights are pretty good quality for the price. I needed three to install over my artwork so I didn’t want anything too expensive. They are plastic, but once installed you can’t tell. The remote is great, and allows you to use two different color settings. I painted the ends of mine gold with rub and buff to give them a bit more detail. Overall very happy with them. Keep in mind that they do extend out quite a bit from the wall so I turned the light part of the fixture as far down as possible so you don’t see it.",1
"Love it , works beautifully, just a little top heavy , but overall works great !!",1
Super easy to install. Remote is great. Black option is plastic. Looks cheap.,1
"For $68 it is not worth it. The light colour are warm or bright with timers, that’s nice but that’s about it. The “gold” light has a traditional gold neck but the two end pieces are more rose gold, fake plastic which I’ve tried to capture in the photos. I talked to “influencers” who bought this in USA and theirs is much better and for $25. If you’re in Canada do not buy this product unless you’re desperate and maybe buying black as it’ll probably be all the same shade. Definitely going to return, sadly.",0
"Received item promptly, pleased with product.",1
Easy to install; lights up the painting,1
"We were looking to add decor to a living room wall. Decided on three vertical pictures with the wireless pictures light over them. Just love it! The color, light, size is perfect!",1
"It's almost perfect, my only problem is it's a big picture 3ft by 2ft and I SHUD of got a bigger one, my fault",1
These were so easy to install. Installed all 3 within 10 minutes. They have a built in level and the lights pop on and off for easy battery change. Adds a sophisticated look for cheap! Highly recommend.,1
"This remote controlled picture light is perfect for lighting up a work of art that I love to look at. The light was easy to assemble and install. I wouldn't hesitate to buy another. In fact, I'm planning to do just that.",1
I love this little lamp! It's a great way to elevate a little corner of your space....especially if renting since it does not require hardwiring. My only complaint is that the batteries have to be changed quite often to keep the light on and noticeably bright...But the batteries are simple enough to change.,1
Excellent,1
I really like this light! It looks sharp and provides perfect lighting that you can turn up or sun. Make white or warm etc.,1
This art display light is one of my best investments to date. It does not look cheap and best of all it is easy to install and NO electrician is needed to do the installation. It comes with a built-in leveler and any person can install this.,1
Very nice,1
Light is not bright enough. Not useful for artwork,0
Perfect,1
This light is amazing. I bought it to see my clock in the night when I am in bed. All I have to do is use my remote control to turn it on or off.,1
Too dim,0
It looks like it cost much more than it did!,1
The bright gold matched the frame on my picture perfectly. The best guidance to centering and leveling the light for installation. I wish all things came with it. Definitely buy this again if I need another light.,1
Great light but there are color variations we didn't know of at purchase. Its rose gold and gold. We thought it was all one color. We still hung it up and kept it. Would have preferred all gold.,1
"Absolutely love these! Fast one day shipping and I was able to easily hang these in my home office!
There is a 'leveler' included with the mounting piece and the fact that you slide the main light onto this allows for easy, no fuss, no mistake installation. Went from package to wall over my pictures in my office in less than 30 mins for all three lights and pictures!
Well worth it and I love the fact the lights are remote controlled so I just point click, dim or change the color and I'm done. Will add a photo later! Thanks",1
Nice for the money,1
"Simple to install, happy with light output, very adjustable for light direction/ brightness/ three color temps/ and nice timer feature. Really helps this metal art pop!!!",1
Liked the level built into the mount so you can hang straight..easy. Light not as bright as I hoped but just enough if the room is dark..,1
"This product works very well. It illuminates my large oil painting (30” h by 40” w). Remote has quite a few settings to choose from in terms of warm/cold light, brightness and timer. I would definitely purchase this again for other paintings.",1
For the price this is a great little picture light! I enjoy the ability to go from cool to warm light. Timer is a plus too!,1
Nice picture lights! They aren't metal on the actual light and back plate which is a bummer but for the price they are great.,1
This is a great lamp for using to light artwork in the evening.,1
These lights are so gorgeous!! It’s a must buy!,1
"La lampe n'est pas assez efficace, et le retour de la lampe chez le fournisseur nous coûte plus de 30% du coût d'achat. Donc pensez y bien sérieusement avant de faire une commande.",0
Remote control quit working in two weeks.very cheep remote but it’s made in china suprise.,1
Works ok but a bit small for my 3' wide print.,1
so i could see the clock,1
Beautiful absolutely gorgeous,1
"In the picture the gold colour of the metal and plastic( it’s all plastic except for the bar) are the same...in fact, only the metal bar is the same colour as the advertised item...the plastic is very bright old gold. I am luck that my picture frame can handle this colour above it....it would absolutely not work with a more modern frame or setting.The item is very cheap...the plastic got scratched as I was installing it. I am keeping it because it serves my immediate purpose, but I would certainly not recommend it.",0
Really great for looks and very easy to hang! I love them I bought two!,1
Light so dim that it's useless in illuminating my wall art. A couple of candles would be more effective.,0
"This light is awesome! Perfect for our dark hallway. Light is great, easy to mount and remote has lots of options and good range. Highly recommended",1
"Very dissatisfied with brightness. Not bright at all, even with fresh batteries. Lousy light!.",0
"I used this to highlight a new piece of art I recently purchased. I looked into many different styles and varying price points and this was perfect. Looks very expensive but the price was perfect. I would rather spend my money on the artwork and not a light. It was easy for my husband to mount just took a couple minutes to hang and I love the fact I can adjust the 3 colors - a bright white, warm gold and a combination of the 2. There is a timer as well. I love that it is battery operated and can easily be turned on and adjusted via remote. It is modern looking and has the same features as the 200 and 300 dollar models I saw on other sites. The color matches the frame beautifully. I am very pleased with this purchase and would definitely purchase this light again.",1
The product is good looking and works very well. I did not install it but it did not take long to do for the person who did. I wish it were a bit brighter but it serves the purpose of illuminating the painting I’m using it for.,1
Beautiful lighting,1
The ambient light is beautiful on my portrait,1
Missing remote control,0
Great Light with ability to change from daylight to soft and has timers for 15:30:45:60. Easy to install. Comes with drywall anchors:screws: template for drying and level in bracket. Love it. Getting two more to complete my highlight my art.,1
"I purchased three lights got them ready for installation (did not install batteries yet) and left them on my desk overnight. I came back the next morning to discover the plastic on the reverse of one light leached, stained my desk, ruined the finish and I can't get it out. Hey! Luxsway people. Explain this. Are you going to pay to get my desktop refinished? Beware, these lights will ruin wood finishes. What really sucks is that the lights work well, light is good, remote is good. I can't risk destroying more wood.",0
Lights up a dart board just fine. Controls are great. Color looks cheap,1
Not bright enough,0
It highlights only about 20% of the painting it was installed above.,0
Light up a picture on a shaded wall,1
Works as expected. Very irritated that they are practically orange instead of brass. Ew. But a few coats of acrylic paint and they came out alright. Just be prepared that you’re in for a DIY if you want a brass light.,0
"I was really excited to find a picture light that was battery operated and dimmable. Unfortunately, this light is not very bright and the battery life is surprisingly short. Another downside with this light is that there is no way to turn it on or off without the remote. So, if you lose the remote you basically have a useless light. I would not buy this item again.",0
Poor light,0
Lights up our Kincaid painting beautifuly. I love the timer and ability to use either white or a yellow light.,1
I purchased this back in October and it no longer works. I’ve changed both batteries on the light itself and remote control and the light doesn’t turned on.,0
"I'll admit I had really low expectations for this. But I was simply looking for a way to highlight a large piece of wall art without needing to deal with a cord to hide. This light is awesome in appearance, and although it's plastic, it's not flimsy. The gold leans more towards rose gold, but hey....it's gold and that's a fun theme I have in this room. It has a low and high light output setting, which is good because I'm not a fan of the bright white LED bulbs (even the high setting isn't obnoxiously white). An added bonus I didn't even know about is that it has timeframes you can set it to stay on - 30, 60, 90 or 120 minutes. This is great for me so I don't have to wonder if I forgot to turn it off or not. I probably should have dove into the mounting instructions more, because it took me a couple tries to get it on correctly. But the mounting bracket even has a built in ""level"" for easy straight mounting. Overall I'm extremely happy with this purchase!",1
This light arrived without a remote included in the packaging. I’m very disappointed as I will have to return the item now.,0
This light is exactly as described and I'm using in a darkish corner to highlight an oil painting.,1
Works well and easy to install but the plastic is not even close to brass colored. It’s a weird copper/orange color. Completely different in color than the curved arm of the light.,0
TOO DIM TO DISPLAY A PAINTING AND REMOTE IS TRASH,0
The picture is gold but it was copper when it came in the mail. I ordered two and both were copper not gold.,0
Battery is dead after about 3-4 uses. It's a complete joke. I'm throwing them out and getting better ones.,0
Easy to install and works exactly as described.,1
ITS NICE,1
"Easy install, bought 2 and the remote works on both. Like the timer feature.",1
"I am a professional artist, I have a studio in my house and display rotating work in our living space. I have clients comment on how well displayed my work is in my home. These are not fancy or expensive but they make a big difference",1
"I’m so glad I purchased these! Affordable price, doesn’t look cheap (from afar), and offers a range of settings for brightness and direction. Exactly what I was looking for to help make my narrow hallway cozy without turning on all of my ceiling lights for longer hours.",1
Read the installation and yet felt unprepared. I'm still unsure if their up correct.,1
"If you were looking for an orange toned gold, this is the one for you. But for the typical faucets and just general gold and an interior, this cold will definitely be way too warm and peachy. Will be returning in hopes of finding another one online that is a better match. The worst part is the anchor/arm that holds the light to the battery pack is the proper gold so it doesn't even match the light itself.",0
Screws a little too small; easy fix,1
A great little light. One caution: you don't want to use this (or any) picture light on a picture with glass. All you'll see is a reflection of the light.,1
"It really works well for the money. I attached it to the ceiling really easily. It's kind of a funny color, not gold and not brass, but metallic orange. It's okay though.",1
"I really wanted to like this, it is clearly very solid construction and the remote works well. Has the functionality you want. However, the neck is made of metal and the light/battery pack are made of a plastic with a colour that does not match. Kind of ruins the effect of hanging it over a nice painting in our living room. Unfortunately, had to return it.",0
Love the easy install and settings!,1
Very cheaply made.,0
Good product but very small so doesn’t look good,0
Suitable for small to medium size wall art. Liked the many control features. Company quickly response to questions.,1
Purchased this picture light for a picture where there was no access to electricity. Worked fairly well for the first week or two but went through batteries very quickly. Then it simply stopped working. Changed the batteries in the light and the remote. Still nothing. Terrible product at a ridiculously high price.,0
Picture highlighting,1
Nice light placed above my bar and above some pictures.,1
Very weak lightning and the batteries run out very fast.,0
Perfect 5 stars! Super easy to install. Looks like a gallery piece. Perfect brightness. Love it.,1
"Nice product , it could be a cheaper price since the material is very cheap overall 7 out of 10",1
,1
Easy to install and exactly what I wanted! Remote control is the bomb!,1
"Nice product, not the gold that I wanted looks more orange but still works nicely",0
Easy to install. Not very bright on any setting with new batteries. Batteries ran out fast when only on from 6pm-9pm and not every night. I am in a rental and it will leave holes if I take it down. I would not chose this product again.,0
"I bought 4 units. They all died completely, even with battery change, within a few months and with very light usage. A complete waste of money and effort.",0
"Nice light add a lil flare to your space. You see i was all excited when I wrote my first post. That's why is always good to wait after a month to write a review about a product!
I received this light October 3. I set it up. The light was working good, very bright.
Lastnight I tried using the remote for the light and its not turning on.
Can you imagine all I got was 1 month usage of the light and it STOP WORK! Whoever the owner of this company I am demanding a new light that actually has a life span with and remote.
Today is exactly A MONTH, since I received this light and its not working. I am extremely disappointed in WITH this product.",0
"The light output color has two options, one is more of a blue(ish) typical LED color look. The other is a softer, more halogen look, although my personal preference would be for it to be a bit more yellow.

Also, my unit is slightly crooked. It's mounted straight, but the lamp itself is either slightly bent or just built crooked. Not super noticeable at a glance, but the more you look at it, the more you realize its misshaped.",1
Good product for being battery operated. Great price!,1
"I wanted to highlight my paintings with spot lights. I'm glad that I only purchased one to test out. Mounted directly above my 30x40"" painting, it only lights up the first twelve inches at best on its highest setting. It's something you'd expect to find at Dollar Tree...in fact, I bought a $1.00 LED lamp from Dollar Tree that performs much better than this light does. Think, nightlight, only with a slightly wider beam. Do not recommend for any purpose.",0
Great simple light to go in our kitchen. Easy to install but as others said the color is not a true gold all over. Closer to a copper color in some places.,1
I was looking for a cordless picture light and purchased this item. It did not suit the picture and area that we were using it for. When I tried to return it I found out it could not be returned… now I have a $75 light with nowhere to use it.,0
"Easy to install, had an orange hue so I had to spray it gold. It looks nice but cheap.",0
"Got this product end of Dec and have already changed batteries twice. Energizer, good batteries not cheapies, and they need changed again. I am so disappointed. For whatever reason this light eats battery juice up so fast, it’s not worth having.",0
"Luxway picture light, remote does not work, very disappointing, the time I have tried new batterys and try to fix it is crazy, please send me a new remote that works. Thank you Terry Todd",0
"I really like this item, the only con that I have is that the batteries run down to fast, otherwise it is a great purchase",1
"The IR sensor is positioned so it's facing backwards. I had my doubts about the correctness of this. But somehow they got it to work , with the sensor facing in the opposite direction. The IR beam of the remote evidently is being reflected off of the base battery into the sensor. I think it still would've work just as good or even better if the sensor was facing forward . But the designer appears to be going for aesthetics, preferring a smooth continuous profile with the sensor hidden away. They rely on bouncing the beam into the sensor. The timer is just a interval type count down timer. It's not a day/ night type thats turned on and off by room light level. A minus I think.",1
The light is not very bright. It does not give a good amount of lighting to the wall. The battery also died very quickly,0
"It has a very attractive look. I placed it above a Thomas Kinkade picture and it looks fantastic ,just received it today already up and going!!",1
"light weight, good color- easy to use with remote control and the battey powered spot light for art is beautiful",1
It's placed high on a wall over a print so it appears expensive even though it's plastic.,1
"I bought this unit for a medium size painting. The remote control unit worked as expected but the on/off button on the unit did not function. I wish the light were brighter, but it is after all a battery unit. When mounted on the wall the copper color didn't look right with my decor. So I bought some Sharpie jumbo sized markers (black) and carefully ""painted"" the entire unit with them. It looks fine now and doesn't distract the eye from the painting.",1
I love it! Easy to install and great to set the mood in your home with the different brightness & tones!,1
"If you're on the fence get off now, and buy a proper electric lamp. The rate this lamp gobbles batteries is infuriating, annoying, and wasteful.

Purchased to illuminate a large photograph in the living room and for ambient light, for an average 3-5 hours per night, which required changing the batteries THREE TIMES IN A MONTH.

My only recourse at this point is to install it in a closet with the remote handily nearby for quick on and off pops of light as needed.

What a regret. Save yourself headaches and get a plugin lamp. KTHXBYE.",0
"Absolutely love this light!
It’s lightweight and easy to install. Love that it comes with a paper template so you know where to make the pilot holes.
The remote control works well. I like a warmer light, not bright LED. So love that I’m able to change the warmth and brightness.
Will be buying more for my home.
If you’re looking for an inexpensive art light that works well, look no further!",1
"Received August 3rd, worked fine for 4 months of intermittent use, had to replace batteries once. Stopped working. Checked battery in remote "" no problem"", replaced batteries in lamp "" batteries that work in other device"". There is no manual switch to determine if problem is light or remote. Disappointed. No option to return for replacement.",0
I was so excited about it but unfortunately its not that bright in the dark,1
Just like it stated,1
Loved everything about it the price the delivery,1
"These are the best for hanging over a picture framed or not. This is the third order of these lights, as I love using them.",1
"Good light. cheaply bult, but looks nice ..just battery drain too fast",1
Simple to install comes with all mounting hardware a level built into the mounting bracket,1
Didn’t provide any light for the plaque we used it on,0
This light fixture is a perfect fit to light up my clock. I love that it’s battery operated and has a remote. We bought two more to put in my sewing room.,1
This is my fourth LUXSWAY picture light. Easy to install and remote works perfectly.,1
Easy to up. Nothing to it!,1
 Love these lights. Easy to put up. Love that I can put a timer on and go to bed.,1
so beautiful and they are so easy to install I like that comes with the leveler to see if it straight Also it comes with three remotes one for each late but one control works for all,1
"I like everything about it but the difference in colors - the only metal part is the curved bar and that’s a gold paint while the rest is more of a rose gold - but overall I’m very satisfied with my purchase, looks really great and you can’t beat the price! Very easy to install: measure, mark, drill, screws, done! The remote and all the functions is amazing!",1
"Great light for the price. Was referred by a friend.
I had ordered “ The Big Light “
By accident. Easy to say “The Big Light “ was not big . Luxways light is bigger and gold or brass color is nice.
Weird coincidence. Both lights seem to be made by the same manufacturer. The remotes operate both lights.
But overall the luxways light is very nice.",1
Works perfect. Just what we wanted. And the timer feature is just a plus.,1
Really love this on at night to highlight the painting and to add subtle light in the room. The three light settings are great. I prefer the warm light to match my lamps. Had to use fairly strong double tape to make it stay which is fine. But a definite way to make you feel like your house is a bit bougie!,1
Very nice product I just assumed it turned off and on automatically once you set the timer but it doesn't,1
Easy to install and a lovely light to show off a taxidermy bat mounted in a beautiful gothic shadowbox. I plan on ordering a few more for my photos.,1
I love these!,0
I’ve had this product less than two years and it served its purpose but would buy plug in next time. Easy to install and lights up well. Batteries drain relatively quick. The battery well rusted out quickly and made it unusable. I did love this product while it worked but it’s only a temporary solution. I bought two and for over $60 I would have liked it to last a little longer. Will be buying plug in next time.,0
"the company doesn't tell you the light is colored on your painting then when they contact you they are no help saying they know but the pure white light only comes with the black light very disappointed they need to clarify.
I took it down everyone made comments about how ugly it looked on painting don't buy it.",0
Drains three batteries every week and the frequency for the remote is the same as a Samsung TV so every time i change the volume on my TV it either flickers the light or turns off completely. Remote doesn't cycle through all light modes only two modes so you still have to manually choose.,0
quit working after 2-3 years of very little use. changing batteries no help,0
We were going to return it as it didn't work for us as well (using for a dart board). We ended up keeping it and installing more lights around the board.,0
Inexpensive yet attractive way to show off art. Well worth the money.,1
"These lights cast beautiful bright white light on my paintings, and make cheap paintings from the local discount store look much more like art. The only problem is that they operate on three AA batteries, and the light dims pretty quickly. I would say, that after three days of three of four hours of use, the batteries need to be changed out, which is pretty inconvenient.",1
"Easy to use and nice features. I only use when I'm doing a portrait unveiling for my photography clients, so it has limited usage. Stayed on for as long as I needed it (a couple of hours). Don't know how long it will stay on before a battery change is needed, but it serves my purpose. Could be a bit brighter, but should work well for most situations.",1
I find this light saved me from all the problems of going the old way,1
Are use it for pictures and paintings and it’s working fine so far,1
It is worth recommending,1
"Bought this for my dartboard, and it works pretty well. Easy to install and it actually looks pretty nice despite being plastic. My only gripe is that the light was crooked and didnt line up with the base - they weren't perfectly parallel with each other. So my husband and I had to clamp the bar and manually bend it a few millimeters to straighten it out. Other than that I'm happy with the purchase and is worth the price.",1
The light only lasted for one week!,0
Very pleased with this product they are a perfect accent to my home,1
"I bought one of these wanting to not only light a painting but to dress up my wall as well. Not only does my painting look better with the added light, but the area looks far more professional than I dreamed. The light added instant class and upped the focus of the room. It was easy to install and comes with a remote that’s user friendly to use and works well from across the room. I would definitely recommend this light. I bought it in black for Halloween, but because it’s easy to install and remove, I’m ordering gold for Christmas.",1
"With limited placement options, there is a strong lighting glare for paintings under glass, and I would not recommend this item for those uses.",0
The installation is very easy and neat. The light focus is spread out which is good. There is fair amount of adjustability for moving the light's focus vertically. Overall material is cheap but doesn't look cheap once mounted. Overall good product for the price. I have one more painting to hang and would order another one of these lights. I wish it was a little more brighter.,1
"The gold is very yellow, but I don't mind. I wanted this to not only highlight my mango pastel art, but also light up the sink at nighttime because this area gets really dark. It COULD be a little brighter, but I shouldn't complain because it's better than what I had before.",1
Easiest to install I have ever encountered. A little brighter would be better. Easy to change setting from warm to daylight - just push a button. Separate button on remote for each setting option made everything very easy,1
"Se mira bien, gracias.",1
Pretty nice,1
Like the light...buttons on the remote are stiff to push....,0
"Fácil de instalar, un poco pesado para mi gusto y no tiene un gran ángulo de luz",0
This is the most handsome picture light I have ever used. It lights up my painting with a soft dim light. Controls work perfectly. Very easy to install with few tools needed. This doesn’t emit a bright light (1 lumen) onto the picture. The manufacturers need to work on that. My light came a little crooked so I had to send it back so check on alignment when you receive you product. That should be corrected before shipping.,1
The mount even has a built-in level and the remote is intuitive. Thought it was expensive but impressed by the build quality. Will buy again,1
This light was a great value for the money. The light is not super bright but I like it soft. Works well for my space & I love the remote.,1
Nice lamp for my big picture in living room. Good working with remote control!!!,1
It was great for about six months. Replaced both batteries in lamp and remote and it no longer works at all.,0
"It’s perfect and looks fantastic!
I wasn’t expecting it to be as good as it was!
But I was surprised with the results...",1
These lights are good priced and instantly elevated our space. Super easy to install and was happy to find out one remote will work for both lights,1
Great addition to a clock that is hanging about 15 feet high in my cathedral ceiling. It gives great light and I really like the timer features I highly recommend,1
"I ordered 3 and 2 worked. They are easy to install but cheap looking, from far away they’re okay.",0
"A designer on YouTube recommended this light so I thought I’d try it. For the price, it’s a great light. Looks nice on the wall. Highly recommend it.",1
For the price you can't beat it.,1
Anyone can install this lamp in 5 min! Looks very elegant. The remote control is a big plus as well as the batteries ... no electric cable connection required!,1
"Love how bright it gets, also with changing the colors of the light. It doesn’t come with batteries you have to buy them yourself. 3 (AA Batteries are needed) highly recommended if you want that luxury feel of your art work or even for your mirrors.",1
The light is not parallel with the mount and it's all crooked. It's made entirely of cheap plastic and came scuffed up.,0
Nice light no needs for cords anymore. Wish was a littler brighter but works,1
Great light and uses minimal battery if not left on 24/7,1
"This is a fantastic fixture if you don't need anymore than 12 hours of light! As in, it sucks! Great for losing your mind as you wonder with each passing day ""was it always this dim?"". Just buy one with a wire, it's worth the extra cost and hassle.",0
Love this so much! I wanted a light above my mantle but didn’t want to deal with electrical. This was the perfect solution. The gold was really really shiny gold so I took a craft paint brush and brown acrylic paint and went over it a little so it looked like aged brass.,1
We like the choices of cool vs warm light,1
"Perfect for my hallway. So cute, and easy to install and use. I used some 3M tapes to install it on my wall, no drilling. Viola! Gonna buy a bunch more for some art work around the house.",1
The only thing I would have like better is if it had a timer you could set to come on at the same time each night. Looks great and works well.,1
I am so in love with this picture light! It gives my loft a luxe look. I always get compliments.,1
I was very pleased with this purchase. I love the remote is compatible with additional units and the auto shut off. Affordable and seemed like a good value for the price.,1
i love the remote control on this light.....goes from dim to bright. perfect for my aunts special painting..,1
"The batteries do not work, I am disappointed, I wanted to like this product, and now I have buy battery separately",0
"These lights are great for pictures that are not near a wall outlet. The versatility in light brightness, color, and timer make this a great purchase. It was VERY easy to install (has a level on the mounting plate). The lights rotate which allow you to adjust where the light shines. Bought one to try first, then bought another!",1
We used the light to illuminate some pictures on the wall & they work perfectly. Love the remote control. We installed it with Command tape.,1
Dem,0
"1. this is very convenient and beyond easy to install.
2. it's NOT GOLD. this product is rose gold almost copper.",1
Perfect. Easy to install,1
Good quality item. Remote works well. Perfect lighting.,1
I was looking for a cordless picture light and purchased this item. It did not suit the picture and area that we were using it for. When I tried to return it I found out it could not be returned… now I have a $75 light with nowhere to use it.,0
Batteries will only last about 10 days at 6 hours/ day,0
It ins't bright enough to illuminate even a small picture.,0
Does what I wanted,1
I loved all the items I've purchased through Amazon,1
Did not like the copper color it had so I returned it.,0
High quality and multi-functional. Easy to install.,1
"Just what I needed. So easy to operate and many options to get just the right lighting. Looks great on the wall, too. Adjustable and slim design makes you focus more on the picture rather than the light. I bought two (gold and black colors) and love them.",1
"I was tempted not to buy this because of the reviews. It's been up for a week and it works great. Don't know what's wrong with all those remotes not working correctly...Maybe they got bad batteries. Mine works perfectly from 15 feet away. Light dims great. Everything else is superb. Been up for a week, looks wonderful. Couldn't be happier with it.",1
"I bought two. Twice, these lights, after three months, caused the brand new Duracell AA batteries to burst and leak battery acid. This has not happened with any of our many other Duracell battery powered devices.",0
"These were supposed to be all one gold color, but it’s half gold and half an orangey shade of rose gold which I think makes it look super cheap. I would not recommend the gold version.",0
"These are lightweight & made of plastic, but from afar you can't tell. A single remote will work for multiple lights which is nice. Easy to operate & installation was super simple. You can choose a warm or cool tone light depending on your mood. These look fantastic & even if they don't last a super long time, I am happy!",1
"Remote a plus and brightness is
great.",1
Love how classy it looks and to top it all off no wires!!!!(Just 3 AA batteries) I plan to order many more 😍,1
A flexible neck rather than one that is rigid and fixed would be helpful.,1
I love this light!! It is very sleek and looks nice on the wall. Different lighting options are awesome and the remote works well. The timer is definitely a great feature.,1
"This accent lighting fixture came as advertised and in good condition. Easy to install. Being battery operated and coming with a nice little remote, the light can be easily adjusted as needed. However, this is a $25 product, so do not expect ""museum performance"". The light intensity and brightness is quite dimmed even on Max. is it worth the $25? - Yes! Is it something to light a high quality art? No",1
Easy to install. Looks very expensive but worth the money!,1
Warning. This did not come with any hardware.,0
"I love everything about this portrait light. It was easy to install. The back plate detaches and has a built-in level, so hanging it straight is fool-proof. The remote allows you to set timer options, warm/cool light tone, and brightness. I will definitely be buying more!",1
The light is everything it says it is. Very easy to install. Has a remote that works from quite a distance and the light gets the job done.,1
Easy installation. Warm light capability,1
Would prefer if you could change the angle of hook on light. It works fine but doesn’t light bottom of picture well. This is my second one and great for price and ease of use.,1
Super,1
Excellent Buy!,1
"Very low quality item,it`s falling apart right in my hands.",0
"Bought this light mainly due to the remote control. Unfortunately, no remote was in the packaging. Seriously considering returning this item.
My original review was 1 star.
Luxway reached out to me concerning the missing remote and their desire to make things right. Luxway sent a complete picture lamp that included the remote. The remote works flawlessly - no issues with the timers or the dimmer. Luxway gets a 5 star from me.",1
Beautiful Perfect for my artwork lighting choices are beautiful color is more copper than gold but still elegant I’ll keep them anyway would definitely buy more,1
Great light for 25$. I’d love to have one hardwired into the wall but I move my stuff around a lot. This is a great light for a family heirloom. I’m going to get a few more. Love it. Super easy to hang as well.,1
"Great light for the price. As other reviewers have stated, this does have an orange hue to it. I fixed that with a can of 18 karat gold spray paint that I bought at Michael’s. It’s perfect now.",1
Lighting is not bright,0
It worked fine for awhile and I think the remote battery died. I can’t open the battery replacement slot so now it doesn’t work at all! It was also a little bit crooked. I wish I would have returned it right away but I didn’t. So now I am stuck with junk.,0
The product came with very helpful mounting hardware that made it easy to hang the base on the wall and ensure it was level. Unfortunately the actual fixture is not even so it looks off level even though it was mounted properly. Disappointed because it looks janky and I’m unable to fix it.,0
Works just as described and does just as described. This was worth every dollar.,1
"Very easy to install, and works great!",1
It’s very easy to put together and use and I do like the remote control but it’s nowhere near as bright as I thought it would be and it doesn’t really illuminate a large painting.,1
I have a dark room with no electric so l am redecorating it to be very light. I bought this to illuminate artwork. Sleek and works great for the job,1
"I used a clear command strip to hang, so that I didnt have to damage the walls, so installation was a breeze. I used it in my foyer, and it adds so much character to a plain canvas painting, and for such a small price. Also adds subtle ambient light acting like a nightlight when all other lights are off. Ill be ordering a couple more for my living room.",1
Very easy to use. Much more convenient than a wired picture light if you have furniture below the picture. Really like having the ability to use the remote to control lighting intensity. Good color rendition.,1
Terrible light. Purchased to illuminate a needlepoint portrait. It won't stay lit for more than 15 minutes. Have changed all batteries twice - doesn't improve anything. Too bad - it looked nice hanging over the picture frame. Didn't keep packaging - my mistake. Will return it anyway and hope for a refund. It's of absolutely no value to me but I'd like my $32.99. Amazon has never disappointed me - hope this won't be a first time.,0
Easy to install. Lights can changed to yellow or white. Best of all they have a timer.,1
Great art light. EZ to install and use. Remote has timer and brightness adjustable except it is not that bright. More like a low level adjustable light. The curve on the light is non adjustable but works. Highly recommend,1
"Have only used it a couple of times. Not very bright to light the picture. The unit, without being turned on, drains the batteries. I tested this, put fresh batteries in and 3-4wks later, tried to turn it on and they barely glow, as the batteries are almost dead again, and have not used it, and made sure the unit was completely off.

So, summary,,,,, not very bright, the base drains the battery (because of wireless signal?), and you have to be within a few feet for the remote to work.

Also, not flexible on the light mount, it is a hard tube in a U shape, this limits the adjustability.

Pretty useless, but I hardmounted screws in the wall to hold the base, so there it sits.

Would not recommend.",0
I like the color and how well the lighting can be adjusted to highlight the picture I wanted to enhance.,1
"Directionally there isn’t much you can adjust here so you’re not going to get a full wash on a larger picture. It sucks up battery power pretty quickly. It nice that the light is programmable for temp and dim. There isn’t much selection for a reasonable priced cordless battery operated art light, so I guess you have to pick your battles.",0
Not as bright as I thought.,1
"SO easy to mount, so worth the price! I definitely didn’t love the gold at first. The arch is a nice gold, and the rest of the fixture is a bronzey gold that’s a little on the orange side. I really wanted to make this work. It was either this or the black because I definitely wanted to mount these. I gave it a chance and the color is NOT an issue for me anymore. The remote and settings are super convenient and easy to use. Very pleased with this purchase!! No complaints here at all.",1
Just love and very satisfied with this product and I have already ordered 5. Touch of class and elegance over a painting!,1
Very nice!,1
"Everything is fine but it’s not what I expected, I didn’t read that it doesn’t last long and that is what I was looking for but then if you are looking for a occasionally light this is perfect if not better get a plug in one",1
Products light area very small for a larger picture. I don't know why you would have a picture needing light so small for this product to cover in the first place.,0
"Just what I wanted, ordering a third!",1
Ordered three lights. All three lights stopped working even with minimal use. Very disappointed !,0
"The description said ""bright"" but it really isn't - I'm returning it",0
Returned as it was a painted brushed gold plastic finish not quite what I expected.,0
"It’s mostly plastic, close up it looks really cheap. However it looks ok over my pictures. Not work the price though. At most it shouldn’t be over $10-$15 bucks.",1
"It looks very nice, easy to install and the remote makes it easy to turn the light on and off.",1
Lights stopped working three months later.,0
I like this light but the two tone gold color was not what I was looking for. So I sprayed it with Rust-Oleum pure gold paint and I love it.,1
I purchased this item to light a dart board in my garage. Not nearly bright enough.,0
"Looks beautiful and makes a significant difference in the room. Easy to install - appreciate the built-in leveler. We used screws but tape likely would have worked. Adjustable. The multiple light settings, brightness and timer options are great. Excellent product, purchased two and about to purchase one more.",1
"Remote control died after first use, as well as the light. Changed the batteries multiple times and it drains quickly and is not bright. Wasn’t satisfied with this purchase. Better off investing in a higher quality light",0
"I stumbled across these lights and knew they needed a home above my gallery wall. The black it perfect and the remote control makes it so you can have it emit light without hardwiring them in.
The lights have cool and warm light so you can decide which you like best. I am really happy with them.",1
Very nice. I like the colir..sort of a gold/ rose gold. Worked fine for me. Needs 3 AA batteries. Has a leveler on the back. Nice touch. Perfect for what I wanted.,1
"Amazingly easy to hang, high quality, beautiful two settings!!",1
Was hoping for medal not plastic but looks ok.,0
"We love this light, makes for great additional night lighting.",1
Worked as advertised. Very impressive for the money. Brighter would be better; but it's pushing about as many lumens as it can with batteries and LEDs.,1
"Beautiful light, 3 different settings and can be controlled on the light of by the remote. Easy to install with a paper to show where the screws should go and it has a level built in the back piece. Great lights.",1
This works very well over my art. I love it.,1
"I thought this was going to gold, it is orange copper. It looks nothing like the gold in the picture. Had to check to make sure I order the correct color. Says gold, but it’s copper. Returning for sure.",0
"I installed this light above my dining room painting and first of all, it was not bright enough to light up the whole painting. Also, I used brand new high-quality batteries, and they died after just a few hours of use. I would recommend a light that plugs in and doesn't waste batteries.",0
"The product is attractive, effective, and easy to install.",1
"I'm impressed with this picture light, it's plastic but looks like metal ,has several settings and a remote!",1
"Could be a little brighter, still does the job.",1
"In the picture the gold colour of the metal and plastic( it’s all plastic except for the bar) are the same...in fact, only the metal bar is the same colour as the advertised item...the plastic is very bright old gold. I am luck that my picture frame can handle this colour above it....it would absolutely not work with a more modern frame or setting.The item is very cheap...the plastic got scratched as I was installing it. I am keeping it because it serves my immediate purpose, but I would certainly not recommend it.",0
Stopped working in a week!,0
Looks beautiful!,1
Very beautiful high quality,1
I have had the light fixture for 4 months. Turned it on maybe 5 or 6 times and now its is completely inoperable. Can't return it because the return window is close. I read on this site that trying to replace the bulb would be like buying a new unit. Clever! So what do I do? Take it off the wall and take a hammer to it!,0
SO ORANGE!! Not brass like the stock picture shows.,0
it won't work now & it won't repair,0
"The light is not bright at all, will not light up a small poster with main lights out. Disappointed with the product. The pictures from ""buyers"" are highly exaggerated for as brightness of the light. BUYER BEWARE.",0
This item is NOT gold it's a copper/orange color with a gold arm. If you are looking for gold to match your decor find a different brand as this is copper in color. Most annoying mislead on a product on Amazon.,0
"OK. I have a map of the Territory of Arizona 1880 framed all nice and stuff. I have it in the hallway. This light takes it from merely great, to Outstanding. I have a nice magnifying glass stationed nearby. With this yellow light feature I can study my map in pleasing light in the intensity of my choosing.
I pester every repairman and delivery person with my new light and they are to a man; astounded.
Gotta buy some more cool art as an excuse to buy some more of these fine lamps
Oh the lights are adjustable on the stalks, you can aim them at different areas of your artwork.
Nice feature",1
Installed in a dark corner over a picture that I treasure,1
I purchased this for my gallery picturr frames. It is not wide or bright enough to illuminate the frames. The wireless remote works seamlessly. The colors are good. If only they made it with stronger illumination...,0
"The white lights still work, but the yellow only worked for about 15 minutes. You get what you pay for.",0
Horrible color! Is not the color that is shown in the picture and the arm is not the same color as the rest of the lamp,0
So easy to install and the perfect light source for an original painting.,1
The lamp itself is nice. Easy to hang... love the built in level! BUT... It’s two totally different colors. It’s actually so ugly. I’m not happy with it at all!!,0
"Bought in silver, returned. The casing looks pretty cheap and plastic-y. Because you can't adjust the neck outward (you can side to side) you're really just lighting up the top 5 or 6 inches of your artwork. (Mine is 30 x 44) Because it's to close to the face of the art, it doesn't cast a very diffuse light, and you can see the reflection of the LEDS. I did like the warm/cool light option. And not very expensive, so probably fine for smaller pieces that are not reflective.",0
I liked the looks and color but now what do I do with the burned out section,0
"Extremely easy to install, looks amazing! I love it.",1
Love it,1
"The light looks very elegant.I fell in love with it at first glance. It' perfect for our art photo wall. It's battery run so there's no messy wiring. Remote controller makes it easy to control. Looks like it belongs in a art gallery. This was designed with love. Futuristic, elegant, well thought out.Highly recommended.",1
I liked the looks and color but now what do I do with the burned out section,0
"It works well and looks modern. However, the price is a reflection of the quality. Instead of metal it is plastic, so the gold is yellowish, which makes it look cheap. Especially the curved piece. That gold is different than the rest. Probably the black one would be better. I am returning it as it did not work for me.",0
It looks good but it’s mainly plastic. Wouldn’t order again.,0
A lot nicer than another type I purchased that was bulky and heavy. Light weight and easy to install Just two small screws I was able to just use a screwdriver. I love that the remote has a timer and the lights are rotatable. I wish the light was a tad brighter but might be too much of a glare then on glass.,1
love that i have the look of a pre-wired picture light. i would recommend. i purchased EIGHT different ones and this one looked the best for the price range.,1
Saw on tic tok and I love it. I now have four,1
Super cute. It added a nice touch to my wall case. Easy to install. I did not have to wait 12-20 months for my husband to install it either.,1
"These are very nice. The only reason that I didn't give them 5 stars is because the arm of each of the lights is just slightly off center, and there doesn't appear to be a way to straighten it without breaking the unit, so I just let it. It's not so noticeable that I needed to return it, but just annoys my OCD.",1
"i have an 1898 family oil portrait of great great grandma Alice.
she needed better lighting!",1
"Everything works as it should, but be prepared to change the batteries every 2 months.",0
Cheap plastic. Yuk.,0
Battery operated easy to install.,1
used to illuminate a chart but it is much too dim,0
"The quality is very poor. Stopped working after 2 months. Also, the color of the different components don't match.",0
"This is just what I was looking for. I wanted to light up a framed picture and there was no easy way to get power to the place. This went up very easily and is easy to remove for battery replacement. It has multiple brightness levels and selectable light tones from whiter to bluer. It remembers the settings, even when the batteries are changed. I have it on for about 3 hours a night and the batteries (3-AA) last between 2 and 3 weeks. Cheaper than an electrician. I wish the remote had more range, I have to stand very close to use it. But there is a switch on the side which can be used instead. One gripe, don't trust the paper template they give you to drill the mounting screws. It's off. Use the base plate itself for your template.",1
Just is not bright enough to highlight our painting,0
Love this light! It took about 5 minutes to install and it’s color is much prettier in person( not the yellow gold). You can literally hang these lights anywhere!,1
"I do not recommend, light is low and batteries run out quickly!",0
"I was very hopeful that this product would be good, unfortunately it wasn’t. It is gold plastic with gold metal. It drains the batteries even if you do not use it. Finally it is just not bright even at the highest setting. Wish I would have returned instead of waiting on it to grow on me.",0
"This is pretty cool. It adds extra highlight for your picture frame. Especially for night time, it kinda focuses on the frame to make that picture frame look good.",1
It was so easy to install and beautiful the first time i lit it up but then the light stopped working and it no longer turns on even after changing the batteries.,0
Very beautiful! Worked perfect for our art in our apartment. Also super easy to install!,1
"The gold on this looks very cheap. The lighting is just OK, it really doesn’t throw too much brightness.",0
This light was a good choice for our application but it is not bright enough for a larger picture. Unfortunately I will be returning this item.,0
"This was super easy to install and get set up. The remote controls are a little finicky but honestly I’m not turning them off/on very often.

It doesn’t emit a lot of light but is perfect for the gallery wall set up.",1
"This has been a really nice picture light. It's light weight , looks great and the remote is a plus. I have a few paintings and this light makes them stand out.",1
low cost/features,1
"The light it gives off isn’t very soft, but it looks nice for the price.",1
"Was not as bright as I thought, but looks good in the foyer",1
Like the light...buttons on the remote are stiff to push....,0
Love it. Used above large painting. Easy to install and use.,1
"I use this light in my theater room to illuminate the popcorn area. It's great. I was planning on using this above a really nice framed poster in the room but the light did look a little cheap next to the nicely framed image. So moving it over to the popcorn area it fit way better over there and had better function.

The light is really bright in our dark room. I keep it at around 10% brightness and it's the perfect strength needed. 100% is really bright for a room with low lights. The battery life has been great especially since I keep the lights so low.

I do not like the remote. It is typical for lights like this. I can see it breaking at some point which will be a problem but just hoping it lasts. You do have to be really close to use it. Like 1 foot away from the light.

For my purposes this is perfect.",1
"a dear friend painted a lovely still-life that was in a dark corner in my new townhome -
this light solved the problem with little expense!",1
You will burn through 3 AA batteries PER WEEK to use this light. If that does not bother you I say get it. I just put in new batteries again today as you can see in the photo and the brightness will last about 3 days and then goes super dim. We have it in our bathroom in a dark corner so it is turned on everyday. You would expect the brightness to last longer. At least now you know what your getting for the money.,0
Needed this light for a large oil painting. Works like a charm! I recommend this seller!!,1
Way to short of battery life!,0
Work actually as they are supposed to.,1
product was awsome,1
I was looking for a cordless picture light and purchased this item. It did not suit the picture and area that we were using it for. When I tried to return it I found out it could not be returned… now I have a $75 light with nowhere to use it.,0
"It really is!! It replaced a huge clunker of a light that took FOUR D-size batteries and I had to virtually disassemble the whole thing to replace them. This is a nicely made, almost delicate fixture that looks great even when it's not on. We hung it in maybe five minutes and I can see how easy it will be to replace the THREE AA batteries when it's time.
The remote works great with a number of available settings, but we wish the light on any setting could be just a tad brighter (wouldn't recommend for a dart board). A VERY good, attractive product at an extremely reasonable price.",1
"Really easy to install and it’s pretty, but it doesn’t light up a dang thing. I’m keeping it just as a decor but the light doesn’t really light up the picture, you can barely see it, the batteries are new and you can see where it’s changing from gold to white color but super super soft.",0
"I had been wanting a light for our picture, but I did not want a cord showing. This was perfect, and the finish matched our frame. The remote allows you to choose brightness, yellow or white light, timer, and dimmer. It is actually very nice, for the price. It was easy to install, and came with a built in level.",1
"This light is great for illuminating wall hangings. The fact that it uses batteries removes the need for wires and electrician outlets, and enhances its appearance. The remote control works well, and the fact that you can have either ‘cool’ or ‘warm’ light highlights different aspects of the picture. The light is particularly good for small pictures, would need wider light for large ones, so measuring width of your picture for the light is important.",1
It's perfect!!! It works great easy to install and gives that extra touch to my pictures. Just what I need it ❤️,1
Easy to install but tilts down. Battery remote quit too soon and I can’t reach button to do it manually,0
"I like them, I bought them 4 times already.",1
I purchased the black version as I’d read some reviews mentioning that the gold version is two-toned. The black finish is nice. The light is doing a pretty good job of illuminating my 47” wide painting. I wish there was a wider remote controlled version but this is good for the price. I used drywall screws for mounting instead of the screws that came with it.,1
Three stars for the ugliest looking remote you’ve ever seen- but everything else is perfect Bd wonderful,1
"I returned it because the metals on the lamp didn’t match. The neck is a yellow gold, and the base and the lamp are rose gold. I was looking for something that was all yellow gold. I did like that it was lightweight and was battery operated as it was going on a wall where i didnt want to hardwire or have a plug hanging from the lamp. But i did not try any of the features since I didn’t install it because of the color mismatch.",0
"I had a portrait done of my Granddaughter and hung it in my dimly lit hallway. My new light not only lights the portrait perfectly (in many different settings), but it's pretty and they look like they belong together :)",1
These lights are exactly what I was looking for. Very easy to hang & work perfectly!,1
Dim lighting,0
"For a 16 x 24 canvas it might be enough, but mine was 20 x 45 and not enough light.",1
Poor brightness,0
"Used this as lighting for framed movie posters, in our media room. Very easy installation. Remote control works well, and is easy to use. There are multiple brightness settings, and also has a timer. Ended up being the perfect lighting solution, exactly what I was looking for.",1
I put this over my fancy calendar and it is perfect! Draws attention to anything it illuminates!,1
"The product was easy to install. The remote is very convenient and offers a number of options for lighting level, timer, etc. looks very nice with my print.",1
Stopped working after first night,0
They are very nice.,1
The only problem I have with this is the brightness isn’t great and it goes through batteries way too fast. Otherwise it was easy to install and looks nice above the picture.,0
okay,1
flikers and is not bright at all. not to mention it is not gold but a cheap looking plastic color gold,0
not as bright as i wanted,1
Ez install,1
"Word to the wise- the picture shows a brass colored light that is plastic and metal. Okay. When I opened the box, the light itself is actually a copper color- the only part that is a true gold/brass color is the neck. The rest of it is a garish faux plastic copper. I'm going to try and spray paint it instead of return it, but it is not at all the color in the photo",0
"Wanted to use the lights for Pictures on the wall. They were very cheaply made and did not work well. Batteries went bad very quickly. Replaced them with a better light I had use d before. My fault, I knew they were to inexpensive to do what I wanted. Donated them to Goodwill.",0
"The lights are easy to use and lighting is great!
You can adjust the light to point more towards the wall or down wards just by twisting it!
Great price for the product!",1
"Such a nice light for those favorite pictures and soft lighting for your walls with choices of color and brightness.
I love them, I have purchased two.",1
Looks great over painting.,1
" Extremely pleased with how simple the install was. No hardwiring needed. There is a back plate that slides off with holes for each screw, after you screw the plate to the wall, the light fixture slides on the plate nice and snug. I used a level when installing. The remote has 3 different light options: blue, warm, and a mixture of blue/warm. It is dimmable and there is a timer option that I use at night as I’m going to bed. The gold color is a little on the orange gold color versus yellow gold but it still looks nice. The light can swivel as well as twist up or down depending on where you want the light reflected on. Really happy with this product and makes my canvas paintings I made stand out.",1
"The first remote that came in the pack did not work at all. I returned it and ordered a new replacement one. This remote works just fine - although you have to be close to it, pointed directly at it, and press firmly - and the button on the light itself works as described. The lights aren't very bright, but suits our purpose. Installation was easy, and it comes with a nice level so you don't have to measure it. For $25 it gets the job done, but don't expect to have your socks knocked off.",1
"This arrived ahead of time, and was very easy to install for a large painting we have.",1
"I purchased this light mainly because it had a timer function however, the timer does not come on each day at the same time like I wanted. The timer is only for minutes/hourly use.",0
"For the price you can’t beat it. Super easy to install - lightweight . The gold had a slight orange tint to it, so be mindful of that. I actually just taped over the light and spray painted ours with gold spray paint I had left over and then they were absolutely perfect.",1
Quit working after a week,0
Excellent,1
"I bought two of these and they looked fine and worked fine but after only three months, I started using rechargeable batteries because the normal batteries wouldn't last long. I took the rechargeable batteries out and charged them a few batteries at a time, when I went to put the batteries back in they worked fine in one but for the other I couldn't easily slide the battery in like before. I could only push it in snuggley but that would never have worked before I wouldn't be able to get them out again. The batteries had been out for two days and the body of it, where the batteries go, must have warped somehow. Odd because they are plastic. So it only lasted three months.",0
Perfect for the picture in the darker corner. Love it,1
"This product met my expectations in all respects. It was easy to install and I really liked the remote control aspect. Levels of brightness, on and off buttons and the ability to change lighting color from white to museum-like yellow are just great. The price was affordable and the delivery was fast. Will be getting additional lighting units for three other pictures.

Later post: This unit has a built-in timer with four time units, which is extremely handy. You can punch in for 15, 30, 1 hour, or 2 hours and it will automatically shut off. What a great feature!",1
Like it and would buy it again,1
its not bright and the gold finish looks cheap. I think I'll go with the rechargable one to see if thats any better,0
I love the remote idea. Tired of reaching up just to turn off or on!😀,1
we loved our lights. Couldn’t be better. Recommended.,1
VERY NICE,1
,1
Easy to install. Everything you need is included to make sure the fixture is balanced. Attractive looking. Great price. Will purchase more.,1
I like the picture light but the remote seems to go through batteries quickly.,1
This light was a great value. I'm using it for some framed jersey's.,1
"I purchased 2 of these lights and they are very nice,
One of the lights did not include the remote which is really disappointing",1
Looks better in person. Very lightweight and pretty.,1
Flimsy plastic but work great and the flimsy plastic is undetectable if the lights are installed high enough. Works well.,0
easy to install and priced right,1
"We spray painted gold to match decor, would be nice if offered in different colours",1
Love this light for over my picture! Easy to use and just the right amount of ambience,1
"These lights work perfectly! I love the different lighting, the timer and remote control. Exactly what I was looking for.",1
for picture,1
It is easy to install and lights up the picture for added emphasis. Looks and works well except the remote has to be within 6 foot to work.,1
I’m returning it. It is cheaply made and part of it is made out of plastic. The neck of the light is metal and a beautiful gold but the light portion and mounting section are plastic and a copper color. I was so disappointed and confused at the positive reviews.,0
Don't waste your time with this light. If your picture is bigger than a postcard this light will make little to no difference in the lighting and viewing of a picture. Really poor light output so it's being returned.,0
The light dramatically changes the artwork and adds calming ambiance. Super cheap amd easy to install. Love the remote! Every home needs one!,1
Overlightening Painting,1
Don’t buy this. It doesn’t work and you’ll have to go through the hassle of returning it.,0
This product was affordably-priced. It it was attractive and easy to install.,1
"It's nice for the price, remote is interesting....",1
This picture light is great. I especially like the remote allowing me to set the light for different auto turn-off capability. The brightness is perfect for pictures.,1
"Great light ! I just can’t have it all day ON
I installed on my office over a paint
Everybody loved it
Me too",1
"I was super upset, I just installed the light and with only 3 clicks the battery died on the remote!",0
The product is easy to install and gives a warm nice light,1
Nice but remote doesn’t do all 3 settings. It just does cool and warm. I like that the light housing is adjustable and can be turned out to spread the light more.,1
I used to this item for an oil painting. The light is dim the batteries needed to be pushed in a number of times and it’s already out of light. Very disappointed and dissatisfied.,0
"Not too bad, just wish it was brighter & the rod was gooseneck adjustable. I don’t plan on using this for a picture light.",1
"I had high hopes for this because I really hated having an electric cord dangling down the wall, but this just did not live up to expectations. After difficulty trying to screw into wall, we used 2-sided tape to hold it up. The remote worked fine. The amount of light was poor and distorted. When it came time to change batteries (5 days) we decided it was not worth the trouble to put it back up.",0
"Overall this product feels and looks cheap, considering the price. The remote function is neat but the signal isn’t all that strong so I had to be close and aiming directly at the unit. It does not put out very bright light and I noticed that after 3 days or so, the light has dimmed considerably as the batteries had already begun draining. I returned this plastic product and purchased a metal, powered one for not much more money.",0
nice product but the color is awful and doesn’t match. the curved part is gold and shiny and the rest of it is dark copper and matte. not at all like the picture,0
"It only lit about 6"" of the portrait. Didn't even reach the face",0
Looks good easy to light.,1
"This thing is trash. It's cheaply made, the set of three lights on either side will reflect on any pane of glass, and the lights contained in the unit are very dim. The white is PALE white and the warm is basically white. I WOULD HIGHLY NOT RECOMMEND BUYING THIS.",0
Works great.,1
"Easy to install, nice remote control, brightness. Beautiful",1
Fantastic product and super easy install,1
I waited 4 years to put a light over my favorite picture and I didn’t think I could like it anymore until I put the light on it!!,1
Illuminate a painting.,0
"With limited placement options, there is a strong lighting glare for paintings under glass, and I would not recommend this item for those uses.",0
Very nice quality.,1
"Looks great, easy to mount.",1
Really not worth installing. Just too little light.,0
"love the 3 alternative ""colors""/types of lighting on my large wall-hung Native American painting.",1
Didn’t work out of the box. Could not open the battery compartment on the remote to check if that was the issue. Looked easy enough to install if they had worked. Very cheap looking and much bigger than anticipated. Returned immediately.,0
"It looks so cheap and the ""gold"" color is not gold. It's more yellowish and doesn't match any of my art frames. I didn't even try to install it, just sent it back.",0
Very low brightness,0
"This was so easy to install that it blew my mind. I love it's sleek design. It's not as bright as I would like, but it's still a great ad to my portrait that's in a dark corner. I'm very happy with this purchase and recommend this as a good buy!!",1
"Looks nice and easy to setup. Definitely not high end, but was happy with the quality given the price.",1
Looks nice and like the control option,1
Great little light! Battery operated. Remote with lots of color and dimmer options.,1
I wanted a light to brighten my dark gallery corner but have no outlets in the area. This picture light solved my dilemma and illuminates Sadko perfectly. It’s inexpensive and effective. I’ll be buying another!,1
"Bought this a few weeks ago., finally put it up and it lasted one week. There is no difference in the dimming that you can really see. Plus It would cost a fortune in batteries. I do not recommend this.",0
,1
" Bought three 2 are working ok one does not turn on at all , I was very excited about this lights I was even going to order another one in black but after seen the problem that I have with the third light I can’t buy the black one, then I bought a 4th one to replace the one that didn’t turn on well the same thing it’s happening with the 4th does not turn on",0
This light fixture uses batteries at a ridiculous rate even though not kept on all the time.,0
"I was excited to install the light and as I was about to put it in the wall, the light began flickering. I installed brand new batteries and figured maybe they weren't in well, so I tried again. After a few minutes, same thing happened.",0
Easy to install and beautiful! Perfect amount of light over my art in the powder room! Also adds a beautiful glow in a dark room!,1
"I was a little nervous about ordering these, but they were super easy to install, love the variation in light color, as well as brightness levels. I ordered two; to my surprise, one remote will operate both of them without needing to use each remotes separately for each light. Would absolutely buy these again.",1
For the price it’s done very well so far.,1
"Très satisfaite, belle apparence, finition impeccable. Livraison rapide. Correspond à la description et à mes attentes.",1
Nice,1
"With limited placement options, there is a strong lighting glare for paintings under glass, and I would not recommend this item for those uses.",0
I am not satisfied with the result I got after I installed the device. It only lights up the top part of the canvas and the picture that was in the description of the device is so misleading. The light doesn't reach anywhere close to the bottom of the canvas as shown in the picture.,0
"Play Video
 I get so many compliments on these. I just bought 3 more!!",1
I must have over any great picture,1
"With limited placement options, there is a strong lighting glare for paintings under glass, and I would not recommend this item for those uses.",0
Great product but uses up a lot of batteries quickly. I kept it on low and was putting it on every night. Now I only put it on a couple times a week at night.,1
"For $68 it is not worth it. The light colour are warm or bright with timers, that’s nice but that’s about it. The “gold” light has a traditional gold neck but the two end pieces are more rose gold, fake plastic which I’ve tried to capture in the photos. I talked to “influencers” who bought this in USA and theirs is much better and for $25. If you’re in Canada do not buy this product unless you’re desperate and maybe buying black as it’ll probably be all the same shade. Definitely going to return, sadly.",0
Excellent light,1
These are great for the price! Dimmable and you can choose warm white vs the stark look of LED. They came with a template for screws so it was impossible to mess up the placement. Very happy with these!,1
It was very difficult to install (on a brick fireplace) and it is dim. Got it a few weeks ago and it’s getting dimmer and dimmer. I do not recommend this product.,0
,1
"So easy to install, looks great, adjustable light",1
"Better than my expectations,",1
"Easy to install, could be brighter. Remote functions work as described but longest timer setting is 120 minutes. Would be nice to include a 6hr on 18hr off feature.",1
The quality was not very strong.,1
The light is beautiful and easy to install. It even comes with a built in level. I would have given it five stars if not for the fact that it GUZZLES batteries. It takes three AA non-rechargeable batteries. I left mine on as a night light two nights in a row and then had to change the batteries. Needing to do that so often is highly annoying. It also seems wasteful and can’t be good for the economy. I wish this came in a more energy efficient version.,0
Easy to install and I typically use the push button to turn on. I would return if it wasn’t already hung.,0
Love this light! It is not as bright as I would have liked but it was very easy to install (with a built in level!) and it looks great!!,1
Nice light. Wish it was much brighter!,1
Works great.,1
Easy to install. Perfect for over my painting,1
"We installed the light, tested it. It worked at that time. Not used for even 1 hr collectively and it has stopped working.
Waste of money.",0
Like the remote. But wish it was wider and brighter,1
I gave it 4 stars above but overall 2 stars.. Batteries never last and always seems to be issues with lights but unit has so much potential.,0
,1
Item has stopped working. Changed the batteries and it still has not resolved the issue,0
The people who designed this lamp put some thought into making it easy to install. A tiny level bubble is built in to the mounting bracket!!!! That makes it easy peasy to hang it correctly. It’s the first time I’ve seen that. There’s a very helpful paper template too. I think the tiny level has potential to make it much easier to mount things correctly. It’s inclusion shows genuine concern for the customer.,1
Liked the easy installation. Liked how it lighted the picture. Liked it so much that we ordered 2 more for other pictures.,1
Love this light adds a touch of elegance to the living room. Easily to install and hang overall great purchase.,1
"This was so easy to install. But more importantly, it looks great and the price was reasonable. Purchased it to go over a painting of my daughter's wedding. Perfect addition to her new home! Would definitely recommend and will buy again.",1
"So so so disappointed in this. When I first got it, IT WAS WONDERFUL. Bright, working great and easy to use. Then after about a week, the light strength started failing after hardly using it. I thought it was a battery problem but then I put new batteries in. When I took out the old, the batteries were leaking and a white corrosive material was everywhere. I thought it was a bad battery. Put new batteries in. Still didn’t turn on. The inside had totally fallen apart.",0
"Be suspicious of a product that has packaging that says it requires AAA batteries, but when you set it up you will find that it uses AAs. If that was the only problem you could blame human error. However, I was bitten twice by this product. It's design meets our needs perfectly, but design does not overcome cheap materials, put together haphazardly. The first time I bought it through Home Depot and took it back for a refund. I waited a year or so and thought I would try It again -- Stupid!!!!!! It worked for a few days and then nothing. I replaced the new batteries in both the lamp and the controller and still nothing.

Do not buy this junk!",0
Such a nice light for over our electric piano! The 15 minute timer rocks & no cords. Really like the dimmer & different lighting options too. So glad we purchased this!,1
"Great lights for paintings and prints. Light. Affordable. Look great. What's really nice is that once the brightness and color is adjusted the way I want them to be, they turn on again with the same settings.",1
The arm should be longer. Also it should mention what size painting this size light is recommended for.,0
"Very convenient, easy to control.
I was expecting a brighter more illuminating light. It is priced fairly.
I like it, but would look at other brands if purchasing another one.",1
"not a great fit for me, but very good product",1
Nice price and easy install. Could be a tad brighter,1
Love the remote capabilities and love how these look on my gallery wall! Very happy with this purchase!,1
,1
I was hoping for more light and better range. I would have a plug in and better result if I could mount on a ceiling.,0
Makes a dark painting glo,1
"I have a plug-in picture light that is great! I decided to try a cordless light on another painting that I have. This light is weak and doesn’t illuminate the detail that is in the painting. It’ll do for now, unfortunately I can’t return it.",0
The illumination is terrible. Barely lights anything.,0
I love the light and the fact that it is battery operated and comes with a remote is a plus. It also comes with a installation diagram and level which came in hand. I did have to use the anchors that came with the screws and still had issues but this is on me and not the product.,1
I was really surprised how nice it looked in the hallway. Very reasonably priced. Very easy to put up. Love the two different lighting effects that you can choose from with the remote control. Comes fully assembled so all you do is insert the 3 AA batteries and install the wall.,1
"Awesome Product, super easy to set up. I wants a shadow effect for a wine wall and it was perfect.",1
"I purchased 3. Easy to install. 2/3 work perfectly. The 3rd one lights do not function properly. The first time I turned on for 1 hour and it worked great. The second time I wanted to use, the lights turned on but not fully, then would completely cut off after 10 minutes. 30 minutes later would turn back on and then off again. Swapped for new batteries, still the same thing. There must be a short.",1
There are two settings for bright or warm lights. The warm is less bright but not what I would call warm. It’s still too harsh for my taste.,0
It’s plastic but doesn’t feel too cheap. Take proper measurements before installing it,1
The product was delivered timely. It looks great. It was east to install. There are options of light choices for you particular artwork or where it hands. The remote is east to use and works well. I am very happy with my purchase,1
I am so please with the way this inexpensive light looks and works. But batteries are difficult to replace if you are short,1
Beautiful as described lights up very well.,1
Like the light...buttons on the remote are stiff to push....,0
Very easy to install.,1
Made my living room look so upscale. In love,1
Perfect to show case our family flag in our living room. Love you can adjust the brightness and angle and even the color hue. I'd buy this again,1
"A very nice addition to our entry hall, illuminating our stain glass piece above our front door. It is very attractive and easy to install and operate.",1
"I was a little hesitant after reading some reviews, but I am so happy with this purchase! It arrived quickly, well packaged. Super easy to install with all hardware and even a handy template. I light it every day for the past month, and so far the batteries have held up and have not been replaced yet. I also love the adjustable lighting and timer! Highly recommend. Great value!",1
Used the lamp to highlight one of my photographs on our studio tour.....exactly what was needed for visitors to draw attention to the image.,1
Very dim to the point of being useless.,0
Easy to install and love the remote and light timer,1
Works great. Super easy to install.,1
Easy to install everything is good except for the brightness it's not very bright even on the brightest setting but of course it's battery powered,0
Works great I would recommend it to anyone for anybody's pictures,1
I bought 5 and only 3 work properly. 2 arrived brand new and were completely inoperable. Do you guys test them out before they’re shipped out??? The 2 that worked out of the box stopped working after about a week. The remotes are also useless. Several don’t work. This product is obviously a SCAM given the high amount of complaints about the same problem!!,0
" Remote controlled, no plug in needed, timer options. Just beautiful!",1
They look great but the charge did not last very long and because they are high up on the wall charging them is difficult. I paid someone to install them and because I have high ceilings I am not sure how to get up there to charge them. I charged them fully before they were installed but the charge lasted only about 8 hours. One of the remote power switch never worked.,0
"Easy to install, looks good, I only wish it was a little longer but awesome for the price!!!!",1
"We put these over the frames that hold our kids art work. It really adds a nice touch to them.
One remote will work on multiple which is nice and convenient.
The timer function is great as well.",1
It is so easy to install. If I can do it... anyone can do it! It made this mirror that I designed “ pop” with color!,1
Light weight and easy to install,1
It’s a perfect way to upgrade any picture frames or art work.,1
"Beautiful light, so easy to install has so many different lighting options. Obsessed!",1
Works nicely to light up one of my photographs hanging in our hallway. It's a bit flimsy...but it should be just fine.,1
Don’t waste your money on this the plastic is a heinous copper color and looks super cheap the arm is gold but not at all flexible and it doesn’t come down far enough on the picture. I truly don’t understand why they didn’t make the plastic a gold color. Super disappointing piece of junk,0
"Doesn’t work with some antique ornate frames as frame itself is 6” and has depth of 3”. Even mounted as close as possible to top of frame, it still doesn’t work.",0
Improve the remote.,1
 I just finished installing these built in gallery bookcases and wanted a library light to finish them off! I needed a battery operated option until I have electricity run. These are the perfect inexpensive solution and they look great! I love how easy they were to install! Literally under 5 min! They have a remote that works on both of them! I love that they offer a warm or cool light that can be dimmed! I love the black option! I also purchased the gold and was less impressed with the finish! The gold was very orange but I think I may keep still and spray paint to use in a powder room. I’m overall very very happy with how these look and operate… and you can’t beat the price!!!,1
"Luxway picture light, remote does not work, very disappointing, the time I have tried new batterys and try to fix it is crazy, please send me a new remote that works. Thank you Terry Todd",0
Great purchase,1
What I saw visually in my head was not the reality I saw on my picture. Not bright- very disappointed.,0
"I bought two to illuminate a 24"" X 60"" oil painting. Clever design. Easy to mount, although the utility of the tiny bubble level is wildly overrated. Choice of three light temps. Handy remote. Swivel head. Just one little overlooked detail: They fail to throw a useable light. The dimmer button on the remote is superfluous- the light is already too dim at brightest setting. Photos are very deceptive because the light is magnified by the lens. In real world setting, these are woefully inadequate. I should have saved my $50 and put it towards a wired lighting option, which I was trying to avoid.",0
"As long as u DO NOT PICK WARM OR COOL. And u leave all the lights to work, and twist the lights down towards the art, it is great! My painting has some 3D acrylic affects that never showed up before I had this light to showcase them.",1
This is a great light for a big picture to show the details,1
"GREAT PRODUCT IT WAS EASY TO INSTALL JUST TOOK 10 MINUTES AND THE FEATURES GAVE ME MORE OPTIONS ON
HOW I WANTED TO ILLUMINATE MY HANGING WALL PICTURES..",1
"I used it to light an oil painting. The remote is wonderful, easy on and off, and never fails. I would like the light to be brighter but the ambient light it gives off is effective. The physical appearance of the fixture is very nice and super easy to install.",1
Piece of junk!,0
Color is off,0
Looks very nice.,1
I was looking for a cordless picture light and purchased this item. It did not suit the picture and area that we were using it for. When I tried to return it I found out it could not be returned… now I have a $75 light with nowhere to use it.,0
"So little light that it is laughable. Unless you have a tiny piece, this will not do the job.",0
Love the remote control. I did purchase two and they both come with their own control but one control turns both on. It had two settings for a cool white light or a yellow light. Just what I was searching for.,1
Great value. Love the different settings and the ease of the remote. Lights up our painting just right,1
"This is an easy 5 star review. Changed the vibe of my foyer by adding this over a painting. It took it to another level . Easy to install, remote works great and looks classy. I bought 2 more! Thank you!",1
Looked extremely cheap and like spray painted plastic.,0
"To small, not enough light.",0
"We were very happy with this light at first, but the brightness faded within three weeks. We replaced the batteries and it's bright again, but if we have to replace the batteries every three weeks or so, it will be a bit of an expensive and wasteful light.",1
Great Item.,1
Not bright enough,0
"Thought it would be brighter. And yes, I turned it all the way up.",1
"Luxway picture light, remote does not work, very disappointing, the time I have tried new batterys and try to fix it is crazy, please send me a new remote that works. Thank you Terry Todd",0
"These are so great. I searched high and low for some sconces to go in the molding of a built in bookshelf. I kept running into the issue that either the doors would hit the light when they opened or the sconce would hit the ceiling. I also didn’t have the capability to wire lights. Enter these lights. I LOVE them. They fit the 8 inch space I had to work with perfectly, they have multiple light/dimness settings, they’re easy to install, and use. Now the neck is absolutely a different color. It’s a brassy yellow gold. However, I used Antique Gold Rub’n Buff and it worked like a charm. I’m very pleased with these!",1
I ordered gold and what came is NOTHING like what is pictured. It’s practically orange.,0
"Everything was so easy to install, and was better than expected.",1
Great light for the price,0
"Until you add it to your pictures, canvas, or portraits. Evaluated my living look",1
Looks really pretty and easy to install.,1
Work how we wanted,1
"Tiene una iluminacion muy baja, la puse para resaltar un cuadro, y no funciono, ahora esta como puro adorno arriba del cuadro",0
Pour un tableau,1
