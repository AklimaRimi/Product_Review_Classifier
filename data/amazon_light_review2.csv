"It works well and looks modern. However, the price is a reflection of the quality. Instead of metal it is plastic, so the gold is yellowish, which makes it look cheap. Especially the curved piece. That gold is different than the rest. Probably the black one would be better. I am returning it as it did not work for me.",0
"I was really excited to find a picture light that was battery operated and dimmable. Unfortunately, this light is not very bright and the battery life is surprisingly short. Another downside with this light is that there is no way to turn it on or off without the remote. So, if you lose the remote you basically have a useless light. I would not buy this item again.",0
"Not happy with this light. As you can see it only lit up the very top of my painting. The lamp below gave it most of the lighting. This painting is 30"" x 40"" so maybe I should have used two lights but that wouldn't look very good to have two lights. I guess this light would only be good for a small painting. Very small. The remote and easy to install was good but that's about all.",0
Easy to install and I typically use the push button to turn on. I would return if it wasn’t already hung.,0
"No matter how the light is directed, the brightness of the light is not adequate for the size of my framed art. It only lit the top part of the art piece.",0
"The batteries do not work, I am disappointed, I wanted to like this product, and now I have buy battery separately",0
Appearance is fine. All works as it should. Light quality is average. The neck where the light is attached does not extend from the wall very far. When there is even a moderately heavy from the light does not extend well enough to cast a good light over the painting. Too bright just by the lamp and poorly lit otherwise.,0
"I was super upset, I just installed the light and with only 3 clicks the battery died on the remote!",0
I’ve had this product less than two years and it served its purpose but would buy plug in next time. Easy to install and lights up well. Batteries drain relatively quick. The battery well rusted out quickly and made it unusable. I did love this product while it worked but it’s only a temporary solution. I bought two and for over $60 I would have liked it to last a little longer. Will be buying plug in next time.,0
It looks good but it’s mainly plastic. Wouldn’t order again.,0
You will burn through 3 AA batteries PER WEEK to use this light. If that does not bother you I say get it. I just put in new batteries again today as you can see in the photo and the brightness will last about 3 days and then goes super dim. We have it in our bathroom in a dark corner so it is turned on everyday. You would expect the brightness to last longer. At least now you know what your getting for the money.,0
"I love the light—great for the price—however, the first remote did not work so I contacted the seller who promptly sent another. This remote does not work either!! The picture is high and I will need a ladder to turn on the light!! Very disappointed in the remote. I attempted to purchase another but can’t find how. I tried to re-contact the seller, but have not heard anything. If I can’t get a remote that works, the product is virtually useless!!",0
"I have a very long canvas print. I just assumed that the light would hit the entire canvas. I realize this model of light does not have the flexibility acceptable to be able to have it shine on the total of the picture. I will need to buy some ceiling Mounted lights instead.
This would be perfect for a smaller print",0
"For the price, it’s OK, but I wouldn’t recommend.",0
"One of my lights came bent....total bummer. Other than that, they are nice!",0
Easy to install. Not very bright on any setting with new batteries. Batteries ran out fast when only on from 6pm-9pm and not every night. I am in a rental and it will leave holes if I take it down. I would not chose this product again.,0
"I wish I would’ve been more on top of things when this item arrived. I would’ve returned. It looks very very cheap. The light settings are nice, but the fixture itself is crooked, uneven, dull and cheap",0
It came in a weird orange/gold color. The part that touches the wall was orange and the arm and light was gold. Would have been nice but…eh…,0
"I’m actually really disappointed in this item! I had high hopes but it’s just not worth the money. The battery life is terrible, the “brightness” isn’t bright at all and there is very little % difference when using the remote",0
Warning. This did not come with any hardware.,0
"I purchased 2 pieces, only 1 is working , the second one can’t operate at all",0
Looks good and very easy to install but it didn’t last very long,0
"The light is okay but not as good as we would have liked for the following reasons:

When the lamp is on, the light reflect several dots onto the painting. It looks ridiculous, like airport runway lights. There seems to be no way to diminish or remove the dots without turning off the lamp.

We expecting light to emanate from the fixture without the bulbs throwing off 12 dots onto the canvas.",0
"I installed this light above my dining room painting and first of all, it was not bright enough to light up the whole painting. Also, I used brand new high-quality batteries, and they died after just a few hours of use. I would recommend a light that plugs in and doesn't waste batteries.",0
Poor brightness,0
its not bright and the gold finish looks cheap. I think I'll go with the rechargable one to see if thats any better,0
"Very disappointed. Purchased this light knowing that it could be a ""you get what you pay for"" situation and it certainly was. Light was dim after Day #4. And I only had the light on for maybe 2 hours a day if that. Completely drained many batteries. Very cheap material, although from a distance it looks nice. Would have kept it if it wasn't running through batteries and if the light that it produced was sufficient to highlight my art. Off to buy something more substantial.",0
Overall lived it but the color looked cheap so had to return it.,0
"I have a plug-in picture light that is great! I decided to try a cordless light on another painting that I have. This light is weak and doesn’t illuminate the detail that is in the painting. It’ll do for now, unfortunately I can’t return it.",0
"Very dissatisfied with brightness. Not bright at all, even with fresh batteries. Lousy light!.",0
" This is my replacement order after receiving the first one which was clearly returned and the remote was not included. This was packaged in a smaller box which made me feel like it was new and not a return. Overall, glad they made it right but definitely a disappointment. There’s definitely a discrepancy in color, the “rose gold” is not it, but this works for what I want it for. If the little details like that will bother you don’t get this version, but overall I’m happier.

Update: Video added with remote control use. Light works for its purpose. Definitely not the prettiest thing but it’s cost effective. Not sure if I’d buy again but it works for now.",0
"I kept it to avoid the hassle, but would never order it again. When it is installed, the neck is too short and it shines brightly on the top side of the frame, but no matter how it is adjusted, it cannot shine on more than the upper half of the painting leaving the bottom half in darkness. The level that is attached to the plate you use for the installation is not level. There is nothing adjustable about it with the arm having no flexibility except side to side. As I said, don't waste your time!",0
I purchased this for my gallery picturr frames. It is not wide or bright enough to illuminate the frames. The wireless remote works seamlessly. The colors are good. If only they made it with stronger illumination...,0
"I’ve been having to use this just as decoration because the remote won’t cut on and I bought the necessary batteries for this item. I had this product for about 4 months but I’m extremely frustrated because I wanted to use this as a light not just for decoration. I also, don’t know who to contact with the product not being from USA.",0
"When you are unable to contact the seller, this is not good. I’m surprised Amazon allows this. I have several of these small remotes in my home and sell items that also use them. Not once have I ever had such a problem trying to replace the battery in the remote. It literally got destroyed. Since I am unable to contact the seller, I will replace the entire item. I refuse to give company my money if they are an untouchable.",0
"I bought two of these and they looked fine and worked fine but after only three months, I started using rechargeable batteries because the normal batteries wouldn't last long. I took the rechargeable batteries out and charged them a few batteries at a time, when I went to put the batteries back in they worked fine in one but for the other I couldn't easily slide the battery in like before. I could only push it in snuggley but that would never have worked before I wouldn't be able to get them out again. The batteries had been out for two days and the body of it, where the batteries go, must have warped somehow. Odd because they are plastic. So it only lasted three months.",0
"I wanted to love this and thought it would look good from afar, but it is just too cheap looking. I was going to use command strips to attach to the wall. It’s very light. I even spray painted it gold so it had a uniform look because like other reviews, it is two toned gold. Part plastic/part metal.",0
"Purchased this due to price, good reviews and an influencer I follow:/ I was so disappointed when I opened it, so so cheap looking. Like painted plastic. Seemed to work fine and for 30$ what ya expect. Returned.",0
"Nice light add a lil flare to your space. You see i was all excited when I wrote my first post. That's why is always good to wait after a month to write a review about a product!
I received this light October 3. I set it up. The light was working good, very bright.
Lastnight I tried using the remote for the light and its not turning on.
Can you imagine all I got was 1 month usage of the light and it STOP WORK! Whoever the owner of this company I am demanding a new light that actually has a life span with and remote.
Today is exactly A MONTH, since I received this light and its not working. I am extremely disappointed in WITH this product.",0
I ordered this light on Aug 29th. Loved it at first. I don’t turn it on daily. And when I do turn it on I only have it on for 60-120 mins. The light no longer turns on. I have switched out the batteries and even tried using the side button on the light instead of the remote and it still isn’t working.,0
"I bought this and was happy with it , but that was short lived. I bought it to go over a piece of art. I only turned it in stem guests were in my home. I didn’t use this light very much. When it wouldn’t come on I thought the battery was dead. I Changed the batteries with multiple batteries. I tried batteries from different packs. No luck. There is no way to change the battery in the remote without breaking it. By the time I noticed this was not working, the return date had passed. In my opinion, this light is not worth purchasing.",0
"I bought this in March of 2021, so almost two years ago, which means it's not that old. Battery inside fixture died, so I tried to change it but only the first of three came out. The second and third are stuck inside a thick layer of corrosion. I broke a paring knife trying to get them out! Do not buy this item!",0
"Directionally there isn’t much you can adjust here so you’re not going to get a full wash on a larger picture. It sucks up battery power pretty quickly. It nice that the light is programmable for temp and dim. There isn’t much selection for a reasonable priced cordless battery operated art light, so I guess you have to pick your battles.",0
"I was a little disappointed because it is mostly plastic, but I hung it. It looks nice high on the wall. I have only had it a couple of months, and it has already stopped working properly. The light is now very dim.",0
Bought in February 2022 and noticed in August it was not working working when trying to turn it on by remote. Now in November 2022 I tested batteries in light and they were still good since I only used the light on occasion. Replaced batteries and still nothing with either using the remote or the button on the light. Extremely disappointed and now I have a light on my wall that doesn't work or have to remove and repair the holes. Waste of money and time to install with it not even lasting a full year.,0
"I ordered this light to go over a frame that has a gold edge around the matting, however the only part that was gold on this light was the pivot arm. The majority of the light fixture is actually copper in color, which won’t work with my frame so I am returning the light.
I did like the concept of being able to choose warm or cool lighting for my picture and also being able to pivot the aim of the light but the light is not bright enough for the color tone to matter. It only lit the very top part of the picture.
Another thing I discovered is that the majority of this light is plastic. I thought when the description said metal and plastic, that the lens over the led bulbs would be plastic and the rest would be metal when in fact the only part that is metal is the gold pivot arm. All other parts are plastic. Even with its shortcomings, I might have kept the light had it actually been entirely gold as stated in the description. Shiny copper with a small section of gold did not look right together in the light and looked even worse when I put it above the frame that also had gold accents. Very disappointed!",0
"The light is somewhat disappointing because although you can tell it is cheaply made with plastic, it still is a nice shape and aesthetic. The light is also pretty dim even on the highest setting. I would only recommend this if you have fairly low expectations and don’t need a light that is very bright.",0
The light is beautiful and easy to install. It even comes with a built in level. I would have given it five stars if not for the fact that it GUZZLES batteries. It takes three AA non-rechargeable batteries. I left mine on as a night light two nights in a row and then had to change the batteries. Needing to do that so often is highly annoying. It also seems wasteful and can’t be good for the economy. I wish this came in a more energy efficient version.,0
It's only lighting up less than half of my map. That's at full brightness.,0
"Bought in silver, returned. The casing looks pretty cheap and plastic-y. Because you can't adjust the neck outward (you can side to side) you're really just lighting up the top 5 or 6 inches of your artwork. (Mine is 30 x 44) Because it's to close to the face of the art, it doesn't cast a very diffuse light, and you can see the reflection of the LEDS. I did like the warm/cool light option. And not very expensive, so probably fine for smaller pieces that are not reflective.",0
"I returned it because the metals on the lamp didn’t match. The neck is a yellow gold, and the base and the lamp are rose gold. I was looking for something that was all yellow gold. I did like that it was lightweight and was battery operated as it was going on a wall where i didnt want to hardwire or have a plug hanging from the lamp. But i did not try any of the features since I didn’t install it because of the color mismatch.",0
Only had this for a few months- hardly used- and not left on for long. Have needed to change batteries 2x and now has completely stopped working.,0
"Good quality and the remote/brightness modes are excellent but the “gold” color is really an odd orange/copper. The artwork I was going to pair it with has some gold paint and a gold frame which made the copper color stick out like a sore thumb. Even my husband (who has zero interest home decor - ha!) made a comment that it looked tacky.

That said, would still highly recommend the product if the black or silver colors suit your needs!",0
"I really like the way this ended up looking, and it would be perfect if not for the fact that the timer doesn't work daily. Yes I can turn it on with the remote, and choose how long it will stay on for. However it will not turn itself back on the next day. I have a ton of flameless candles and other lighting things in my room that exist on timers 6 hours on 18 hours off. I wish this did the same thing. I would have considered returning it if it wasn't drilled into my wall.",0
"If you're on the fence get off now, and buy a proper electric lamp. The rate this lamp gobbles batteries is infuriating, annoying, and wasteful.

Purchased to illuminate a large photograph in the living room and for ambient light, for an average 3-5 hours per night, which required changing the batteries THREE TIMES IN A MONTH.

My only recourse at this point is to install it in a closet with the remote handily nearby for quick on and off pops of light as needed.

What a regret. Save yourself headaches and get a plugin lamp. KTHXBYE.",0
"Pros: Comes with a remote
-has multiple lighting options
-very clean look, looks great above my picture.
-they give you a paper diagram for screw placement, very helpful.
-cordless.

Cons: goes through batteries fast, I leave it on for about 4-5 hours a night and batteries died in about a week, I have mine up really high cause I have vaulted ceilings so its a pain.

Overall: I am happy with this purchase and I am looking at getting more for some other pictures.
I would recommend this product.",0
"It looks so cheap and the ""gold"" color is not gold. It's more yellowish and doesn't match any of my art frames. I didn't even try to install it, just sent it back.",0
The product came with very helpful mounting hardware that made it easy to hang the base on the wall and ensure it was level. Unfortunately the actual fixture is not even so it looks off level even though it was mounted properly. Disappointed because it looks janky and I’m unable to fix it.,0
I purchased this back in October and it no longer works. I’ve changed both batteries on the light itself and remote control and the light doesn’t turned on.,0
This product is terrible. It drains the batteries even when it's not on. I checked batteries with voltmeter before putting them in they are fully charged the light is off the next day I go to turn it on it won't come on take the batteries out check with voltmeter batteries are dead It must have some sort of short it was a waste of $36 don't buy this I couldn't be any more disappointed,0
Flimsy plastic but work great and the flimsy plastic is undetectable if the lights are installed high enough. Works well.,0
"I bought this light to light up my mother's funeral portrait. I've turned it on less than 10x and I recently tried turning it on and nothing, changed the remote battery and nothing. Sadly now I need to buy another one from another maker since my mom's death memoria6is coming up soon.",0
It looks nice but it's not bright enough.,0
"I was thinking that this would be a much brighter light. But I think this is to be expected because it is battery powered. It does eat batteries faster than I expected. Also, although you have guides to align the screws when installing, I did this all correctly, when I put the light in the wall bracket, the light fixture was crooked. Not much you can do to straighten it. I used a little shim on one side. But for the money, it is a nice little light. I like the remote box, I set the timer for 2 hours. this preserves the batteries a bit. Has three different tones of light. Nice feature.",0
I really liked these lights but be warned they only last a few months. After 2 battery cycles the lights die out and will not turn on with fresh batteries. I’ve purchased 3 of these so far and cannot justify another one. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.,0
"This light is cheap, so you get what you pay for. I can’t get it to hold tightly to the wall, so had to use double-sided tape to keep it flush to the wall. The light arm is also just a tad crooked, and you can’t adjust that part. We will see how fast it goes through batteries.",0
"Easy to use and the remote works great. Bright enough for a basic picture light but for those that though they might able to adapt for other uses like a stairway light, its just not bright enough. Not much brighter than a night light. Color is also an over the coppery collar and so kind of a tacky color. Will not look like copper -- more orange/copper mix.",0
"If you buy this light you will need to spray paint it. It works well. Good for the price but the colors being all different was not acceptable. For instance, the plastic is orange gold and the metal arm is bright gold.",0
"I ordered this with trepidation based on reviews but, for $30, I figured it couldn’t be all bad. Boy, was I wrong. It came out of the bag with wall paint splatters on it! So not only did they send me a flimsy piece of plastic, but they sent me a USED piece of flimsy plastic. This one is definitely going back.",0
"The light is a nice size, nice weight, looks nice. But it DOES NOT work. I went and bought a new battery for the remote and it still doesn’t work. I threw my packaging away so I can’t return it. wasted $30.00. It’s a nice concept, nice in theory but like I said mine just did not work!",0
"I purchased this light mainly because it had a timer function however, the timer does not come on each day at the same time like I wanted. The timer is only for minutes/hourly use.",0
Quit working after 3 months. I've replaced all batteries and it does not power on. Very disappointing.,0
It was great while it lasted. And wasn't able to get a refund or exchange for product. Do not recommend buying!,0
"It worked great for 4-5 days! After you throw out the box, it gets SOOO Dim! I bought 2 - both are terrible ! Don’t waste your money!!!",0
Light so dim that it's useless in illuminating my wall art. A couple of candles would be more effective.,0
"I ordered 3 and 2 worked. They are easy to install but cheap looking, from far away they’re okay.",0
"I like the light's design, but the light is very dim. More to use for a night light than an office space.",0
The light is not parallel with the mount and it's all crooked. It's made entirely of cheap plastic and came scuffed up.,0
The light looks nice above our picture however the remote does not work and the light does not work we changed the battery tried everything. I hate to return since it is mounted on the wall will contact seller for a new remote,0
I was hoping for more light and better range. I would have a plug in and better result if I could mount on a ceiling.,0
Product came without remote and now won't work. I replaced all 2 batteries and it still won't come on.,0
Bought 2…one for me and one for a client. Works great so far….easy to install. Has a mini level on the back plate.,0
"Its nice, easy to use but the batteries die in a couple of days. Not useful if I have to constantly put new batteries in. It takes 3 or 4 batteries, too expensive to use. Wish I could return it.",0
"The look was what I wanted , the light felt cheap and was defective.",0
Poor light strength and curve not deep enough to get around a larger frame. Puts light to close to artwork. Not tecommended.,0
The arm should be longer. Also it should mention what size painting this size light is recommended for.,0
Liked everything about the light EXCEPT for the actual lighting aspect.,0
Other product reviews indicate that this light covers more area than it does. Actually this photo shows it a lot better than it does in person. The first pic is in a dark room - the second is in a lite up room. Neither is to the quality we had been used to where the painting just jumped out at you.,0
"The light is not bright at all, will not light up a small poster with main lights out. Disappointed with the product. The pictures from ""buyers"" are highly exaggerated for as brightness of the light. BUYER BEWARE.",0
" Bought three 2 are working ok one does not turn on at all , I was very excited about this lights I was even going to order another one in black but after seen the problem that I have with the third light I can’t buy the black one, then I bought a 4th one to replace the one that didn’t turn on well the same thing it’s happening with the 4th does not turn on",0
Like other reviews have said this thing definitely drains your batteries in a matter of a few days. Not worth it unless maybe you have rechargeable batteries .Even then it would get annoying changing them all the time.,0
"Easy to install, looked nice and lite the picture perfect. Lasted a month. Changed batteries and nothing. Bought 2 and same happened with black one. Very disappointed in the product.",0
"Overall, the lights do the job I bought for which I bought them. Remote makes it very convenient to operate. The installation was somewhat a pain. The built in level is pretty much useless. The fluid for the level is so thick, the bubble takes forever to move. Then, when bubble centers, it is not correct. I verified this with my on level. Bought 3 lights. All were like this.",0
Don’t buy this. It doesn’t work and you’ll have to go through the hassle of returning it.,0
The only problem I have with this is the brightness isn’t great and it goes through batteries way too fast. Otherwise it was easy to install and looks nice above the picture.,0
"These need to be nailed in the wall as command strips don't work. I tried using 3 of them but still fell right off the wall instantly. You'd need to commit to using these forever.

Also didn't come with remote. When tried to return says non returnable but they said keep them and give me a full refund. Strange business.",0
"I was excited to install the light and as I was about to put it in the wall, the light began flickering. I installed brand new batteries and figured maybe they weren't in well, so I tried again. After a few minutes, same thing happened.",0
"I wanted to highlight my paintings with spot lights. I'm glad that I only purchased one to test out. Mounted directly above my 30x40"" painting, it only lights up the first twelve inches at best on its highest setting. It's something you'd expect to find at Dollar Tree...in fact, I bought a $1.00 LED lamp from Dollar Tree that performs much better than this light does. Think, nightlight, only with a slightly wider beam. Do not recommend for any purpose.",0
"Works great, don’t love the color. Reminds me of more “rose gold” than “gold”. Spray painted it with rustoleum and it looks much better now!",0
"Really easy to install and it’s pretty, but it doesn’t light up a dang thing. I’m keeping it just as a decor but the light doesn’t really light up the picture, you can barely see it, the batteries are new and you can see where it’s changing from gold to white color but super super soft.",0
"Have only used it a couple of times. Not very bright to light the picture. The unit, without being turned on, drains the batteries. I tested this, put fresh batteries in and 3-4wks later, tried to turn it on and they barely glow, as the batteries are almost dead again, and have not used it, and made sure the unit was completely off.

So, summary,,,,, not very bright, the base drains the battery (because of wireless signal?), and you have to be within a few feet for the remote to work.

Also, not flexible on the light mount, it is a hard tube in a U shape, this limits the adjustability.

Pretty useless, but I hardmounted screws in the wall to hold the base, so there it sits.

Would not recommend.",0
"The light has stopped working after not being installed for too long and rarely ever being on. Not sure if it’s the batteries, but they were new. Still investigating. Looks good over my commissioned hand-tooled leather art though. I was able to attach it to the wall with 3M Velcro strips, but it seems a bit heavy to not use wall screws. Hasn’t fallen yet, and it’s been up there on Velcro for almost 3 months.",0
"Looks more plastic than the photos. Batteries don’t last very long, but light is focused and they work for now.",0
"Looks cheap but does the job and has a couple nice lighting options, both the warm and the cold tone.",0
That’s the review.,0
"Fácil de instalar, un poco pesado para mi gusto y no tiene un gran ángulo de luz",0
"So so so disappointed in this. When I first got it, IT WAS WONDERFUL. Bright, working great and easy to use. Then after about a week, the light strength started failing after hardly using it. I thought it was a battery problem but then I put new batteries in. When I took out the old, the batteries were leaking and a white corrosive material was everywhere. I thought it was a bad battery. Put new batteries in. Still didn’t turn on. The inside had totally fallen apart.",0
Ordered three lights. All three lights stopped working even with minimal use. Very disappointed !,0
"Love that this is a picture light to light pictures in places I could not run a cord down to. Lighting options between the warm and a cool work very well. And the light quality is very good. However, I will say, it burns through batteries very fast. Put on a dim setting with only on the warm light setting at 50% or less and I guess I get maybe two to three days worth of lighting out of it at, 4 hours a day. Thank goodness I use rechargeable batteries to light these, though I really don't like having to replace them every 3 days to keep the light on. Wish there was a more battery conscious option to this product. Any suggestions out there?",0
"This picture light is very pretty, but I wouldn't buy it if you really need a bright light. No matter how I adjust it, it still just puts a very small spot of light across my picture. Remote works well. Batteries don't last long. I only use it occasionally and have already had to replace the batteries after only a month.",0
"As you can see from their images, the light shines into the room, and a little on the picture. You can rotate the light, but then it’s illuminating the ceiling and the wall, and the picture. The problem is the light comes from 180 degrees, when it should come from 90 degrees to illuminate the picture only. It’s a bad design for a picture light.",0
They look great but the charge did not last very long and because they are high up on the wall charging them is difficult. I paid someone to install them and because I have high ceilings I am not sure how to get up there to charge them. I charged them fully before they were installed but the charge lasted only about 8 hours. One of the remote power switch never worked.,0
"Perhaps the would work for a small (short) pc. of work. The light only illuminated the top few inches of the painting. adjusting did little good. Mounting it lower, closer to the picture, just made for ugly reflection of the bulbs in the glass. Not for me.",0
So disappointing with thousands of positive reviews. Light barely illuminates top 1/4 of my painting. Need a telescoping arm to cover large painting. ...this one is fixed. Sent it back. Maybe its ok for very small paintings.,0
It was great for about six months. Replaced both batteries in lamp and remote and it no longer works at all.,0
"Not bright at all,I returned it",0
"I really wanted to like this, it is clearly very solid construction and the remote works well. Has the functionality you want. However, the neck is made of metal and the light/battery pack are made of a plastic with a colour that does not match. Kind of ruins the effect of hanging it over a nice painting in our living room. Unfortunately, had to return it.",0
Products light area very small for a larger picture. I don't know why you would have a picture needing light so small for this product to cover in the first place.,0
"Eats batteries, pain to replace. Looks good!",0
Great light for the price,0
Christmas present that only worked a few times... changed battery and still not working.,0
Looks nice and the remote works great but the light it provides is barely visible. Dissatisfied.,0
used to illuminate a chart but it is much too dim,0
"The light is a great concept, it is bent, I tried to install, it does not line up… cannot use, I only tried to install last week",0
Product is great looking BUT EATS BATTERIES SO WAY TOO FAST. I installed Lithium Energizers like I use in my Blink devices thinking they would last 3-6 months - WRONG - I turn this light on 2-4 hours a night and it completely depletes the batteries within 1 week!!! So total runtime is about 10-14 hours - this is a dealbreaker for me - I will Keep the one I opened BUT RETURNING the other TWO.,0
Too dim,0
"The lights bounce back off the glass of the painting causing a glare on the glass. Wanted to return, but I missed the date by 3 days. I would suggest getting a non-LED light, which I had before and was better.",0
"This is made of plastic and totally cheap. It might look great from afar but is really cheap. And it is a nightmare to install as it will not stay flush against the wall and keeps tilting over. I give it two stars because of the dimmer and all. Very disappointing. You buy cheap stuff, you get cheap stuff.",0
Doesn’t give off the quality light I was hoping for and looks super cheap.,0
"Everything works as it should, but be prepared to change the batteries every 2 months.",0
Not strong enough to illuminate a 36” painting.,0
I purchased this item to light a dart board in my garage. Not nearly bright enough.,0
Works fine but is better for shorter pictures. Lights top of painting but not angled properly for lighting whole painting. Happy with light and remote very handy. Would recommend for shorter art.,0
Installing this was pointless. The light isnt bright at all. Does nothing.,0
"I bought two to illuminate a 24"" X 60"" oil painting. Clever design. Easy to mount, although the utility of the tiny bubble level is wildly overrated. Choice of three light temps. Handy remote. Swivel head. Just one little overlooked detail: They fail to throw a useable light. The dimmer button on the remote is superfluous- the light is already too dim at brightest setting. Photos are very deceptive because the light is magnified by the lens. In real world setting, these are woefully inadequate. I should have saved my $50 and put it towards a wired lighting option, which I was trying to avoid.",0
"I have it over an oil painting that is 24"" wide and 28"" tall. The light is just adequate for that size painting.The cool bulbs are very effective for this particular painting but it would better serve a smaller painting. The remote is a good feature and works well.",0
We were going to return it as it didn't work for us as well (using for a dart board). We ended up keeping it and installing more lights around the board.,0
I pulled off the tab on the remote as instructed. Remote never worked. Wish I had tried it before installing. I'd return if I still had packaging. Not happy!,0
Not bright enough,0
"Nice product, but it is missing the remote control. Too much hassle to send it back. Send remote if you can. Otherwise suggest better quality control in packing and shipping.",0
i bought this because i didn’t want to spend a lot of money at RH when it got here its in pretty brand new condition but the remote control broke away. Seller replaced asap week later a brand new remote control is not working again i give up!,0
The light only lasted for one week!,0
"I bought this June 19th. It’s now August 16th. Does not work. Changed the batteries, nothing. $30 isn’t cheap when it’s just a piece of plastic hanging on your wall.",0
Seems to function fine but the color is definitely not what is pictured. It is a rose gold.,0
The light is very low even on brightest setting. The batteries die in this very rapid. Can’t afford to replace them 2/3 times a month. I had a different brand several years ago that I only changed batteries in once a year.,0
"It's easy to set up, easy to mount, it has multiple colors, and a couple of brightness levels. But, it really is not very bright, and the pattern of light it throws is only as wide as the light itself, which is barely 12"" wide.
The description as listed is pretty accurate, and it does say only 100 lumens. Be aware, that is not very bright. I'll keep it, but I would not buy it again.",0
So mad at myself for missing the return window on these. Absolut junk. Cheap look. And all lights are crooked!! Terrible. Spend more money and get something proper.,0
I got it for relatively big pictures. More appropriate for small pictures.,0
"We did not even use them everyday for less than month and no longer than 6 hrs when we do but they have completely drained the batteries. Each light requires 3 batteries. The light is not as bright as we expected as well. Unfortunately, it's past the return window. Too bad because we liked how it had a remote control and a timer and 3 different color options. It's not worth it in my opinion.",0
I am not satisfied with the result I got after I installed the device. It only lights up the top part of the canvas and the picture that was in the description of the device is so misleading. The light doesn't reach anywhere close to the bottom of the canvas as shown in the picture.,0
"Really loved these but after just 2 months they completely stopped working. We’ve barely used them and tried changing the batteries and using a new remote, but still dead. I saw others complain about this issue when I was reading reviews prior to purchasing and figured it wouldn’t happen, but of course it did. Save your money.",0
THis light works pretty good but the batteries drain very fast. Wouldn't recommend buying it.,0
Color is off,0
Color is very orange,0
There are two settings for bright or warm lights. The warm is less bright but not what I would call warm. It’s still too harsh for my taste.,0
Works as expected. Very irritated that they are practically orange instead of brass. Ew. But a few coats of acrylic paint and they came out alright. Just be prepared that you’re in for a DIY if you want a brass light.,0
"Nice product, not the gold that I wanted looks more orange but still works nicely",0
the lights are very dim at best- the remotes controls worked at first but do not do anything- it is to late to return these as they go bad and stop working after the time allowed to return these is reached. I would not buy or recommend these to anyone. sorry I purchased these,0
"This is a fantastic fixture if you don't need anymore than 12 hours of light! As in, it sucks! Great for losing your mind as you wonder with each passing day ""was it always this dim?"". Just buy one with a wire, it's worth the extra cost and hassle.",0
you have to take the whole thing down to get to the battery compartment,0
Did not have a convenient wall outlet. Remote control is good however not bright at all.,0
"Lights stopped working and was RARELY USED. So now I have 6 nonfunctional lights, past return deadline. DO NOT BUY. Don’t make the same mistake.",0
"the company doesn't tell you the light is colored on your painting then when they contact you they are no help saying they know but the pure white light only comes with the black light very disappointed they need to clarify.
I took it down everyone made comments about how ugly it looked on painting don't buy it.",0
Terrible light. Purchased to illuminate a needlepoint portrait. It won't stay lit for more than 15 minutes. Have changed all batteries twice - doesn't improve anything. Too bad - it looked nice hanging over the picture frame. Didn't keep packaging - my mistake. Will return it anyway and hope for a refund. It's of absolutely no value to me but I'd like my $32.99. Amazon has never disappointed me - hope this won't be a first time.,0
"Word to the wise- the picture shows a brass colored light that is plastic and metal. Okay. When I opened the box, the light itself is actually a copper color- the only part that is a true gold/brass color is the neck. The rest of it is a garish faux plastic copper. I'm going to try and spray paint it instead of return it, but it is not at all the color in the photo",0
Just is not bright enough to highlight our painting,0
A saw a review saying a flash light would be better and they were right! I returned all 4 that I bought.,0
Product looks like painted plastic & the color is very very orange instead of yellow/gold.,0
It did not serve the purpose needed,0
I was extremely excited to get this in and bring attention to one of my favorite paintings but it’s so fun it’s basically nonexistent. I’ve tried messing with the batteries and the remote settings and it doesn’t get any brighter. It’s really too bad!,0
Easy to install everything is good except for the brightness it's not very bright even on the brightest setting but of course it's battery powered,0
The light is not bright enough.,0
Not using for picture but for a bathroom wall mirror I use when I need close up attention. Not bright enough for me.,0
A battery eater. Looks nice but feels cheap. You're fine as long as no one touches it.,0
"I was very hopeful that this product would be good, unfortunately it wasn’t. It is gold plastic with gold metal. It drains the batteries even if you do not use it. Finally it is just not bright even at the highest setting. Wish I would have returned instead of waiting on it to grow on me.",0
Onky good for small paintings. Made of plsstic...should have known for the price.,0
I have had the light fixture for 4 months. Turned it on maybe 5 or 6 times and now its is completely inoperable. Can't return it because the return window is close. I read on this site that trying to replace the bulb would be like buying a new unit. Clever! So what do I do? Take it off the wall and take a hammer to it!,0
"The light works great, but the color is orange, not gold.",0
Really not worth installing. Just too little light.,0
This is very cheap looking and bulky,0
It was so easy to install and beautiful the first time i lit it up but then the light stopped working and it no longer turns on even after changing the batteries.,0
The lamp itself is nice. Easy to hang... love the built in level! BUT... It’s two totally different colors. It’s actually so ugly. I’m not happy with it at all!!,0
"While easy to install and the remote is fine, this light is great for indoor art, but not for dartboards and should not be advertised as such. It has to be mounted too high above the board if in a case. Not effective in properly lighting the board.",0
It’s ok but batteries run out soon so it gets dim after a few hours.,0
Illuminate a painting.,0
I bought 2 of these. The bulbs did not generate enough light to light the paintings. The batteries run down quickly generating even less light. I ended up throwing them away. They actually look great but did not do the job I bought them for.,0
I bought 5 and only 3 work properly. 2 arrived brand new and were completely inoperable. Do you guys test them out before they’re shipped out??? The 2 that worked out of the box stopped working after about a week. The remotes are also useless. Several don’t work. This product is obviously a SCAM given the high amount of complaints about the same problem!!,0
It was very difficult to install (on a brick fireplace) and it is dim. Got it a few weeks ago and it’s getting dimmer and dimmer. I do not recommend this product.,0
"This is a poorly designed and functioning product, and would not recommend it to friends or family. The bracket is difficult to secure to wall using nuts and screws provided in kit. The illumination is not adequate to light a normal sized painting. Changing the batteries is not easily accomplished without taking down the paint and heavy frame.",0
"Wanted to use the lights for Pictures on the wall. They were very cheaply made and did not work well. Batteries went bad very quickly. Replaced them with a better light I had use d before. My fault, I knew they were to inexpensive to do what I wanted. Donated them to Goodwill.",0
Gold color is more orange. Not cute.,0
Light is not powerful at all and it arrived defective. The arm was attached backwards and there is no way to turn it around. No good,0
Not too bright. Batteries fairly easy to change.,0
Not bright at all.,0
"It is not enough bright , light is medium goof for small frame",0
"I had high hopes for this because I really hated having an electric cord dangling down the wall, but this just did not live up to expectations. After difficulty trying to screw into wall, we used 2-sided tape to hold it up. The remote worked fine. The amount of light was poor and distorted. When it came time to change batteries (5 days) we decided it was not worth the trouble to put it back up.",0
It requires frequent battery changes. Very inconvenient.,0
"This item is advertised as replaceable batteries, but in fact the opposite. Once first set of batteries run out. The lights are no longer operational. We tried everything. Replaced batteries in the lights and in remote control. Still nothing. So dissatisfied",0
It worked fine for awhile and I think the remote battery died. I can’t open the battery replacement slot so now it doesn’t work at all! It was also a little bit crooked. I wish I would have returned it right away but I didn’t. So now I am stuck with junk.,0
The product looked very cheap when I unpacked it and so I had to return,0
it won't work now & it won't repair,0
Way to short of battery life!,0
I gave it 4 stars above but overall 2 stars.. Batteries never last and always seems to be issues with lights but unit has so much potential.,0
We were nervous about the metal/plastic combo this light had when we ordered and YUP: it's awful. The plastic bits (everything but the curved piece) are VERY orange compared to the yellow gold of the metal piece. We're returning this item immediately; never even tried installing because they look so bad. Great concept; terrible execution.,0
Easy to install and nice looking but the light itself is basically useless. I turned all the lamps off in the room and on the brightest setting I could barely tell there was any light coming from the lamp. Disappointed as for $25 I would at least like something that highlights the art.,0
"I bought two of these. At first, I thought it was a steal for the price. Sadly, they provide zero light. I mean, I want to light up the entire painting, not just the top of the frame. You’re better off taping a flashlight to your wall. They’re going back tomorrow morning. Extremely disappointed!",0
"I purchased three lights got them ready for installation (did not install batteries yet) and left them on my desk overnight. I came back the next morning to discover the plastic on the reverse of one light leached, stained my desk, ruined the finish and I can't get it out. Hey! Luxsway people. Explain this. Are you going to pay to get my desktop refinished? Beware, these lights will ruin wood finishes. What really sucks is that the lights work well, light is good, remote is good. I can't risk destroying more wood.",0
"I wanted an inexpensive art statement light above a large piece of artwork above my piano. I loved the remote control to turn it on at night. I did not use this nightly as I would just forget to turn it on; however the remote and/or the LED light stopped working after 5-6 months and keep in mind, I didn't log hundreds of hours of use before it died. Maybe 15 total hours. Disappointed.",0
"Overall this product feels and looks cheap, considering the price. The remote function is neat but the signal isn’t all that strong so I had to be close and aiming directly at the unit. It does not put out very bright light and I noticed that after 3 days or so, the light has dimmed considerably as the batteries had already begun draining. I returned this plastic product and purchased a metal, powered one for not much more money.",0
I’m returning it. It is cheaply made and part of it is made out of plastic. The neck of the light is metal and a beautiful gold but the light portion and mounting section are plastic and a copper color. I was so disappointed and confused at the positive reviews.,0
"This has something wrong with it; it's like it keeps drawing battery power even though it is turned off. It constantly needs new batteries (I quit using it because of this). The remote battery quit within 3 weeks of purchase too. The arm is not long enough, so when it did work, the light did not shine directly onto the item I was trying to illuminate. I wasted my money on this.",0
This light fixture uses batteries at a ridiculous rate even though not kept on all the time.,0
Control remoto,0
"The gold on this looks very cheap. The lighting is just OK, it really doesn’t throw too much brightness.",0
The finish on the arm and the light are different… a LOT different. I missed the window to return / exchange bc I waited to open. Very disappointed.,0
Well I just opened it the other day and I am super pissed. Maybe it is a dud I won't get to find out because my return date has ended. I can't open the battery compartment for the remote. I have tried so hard to get it out but it is stuck. Can't turn it on I guess either. I just gave someone some free money. PISSED,0
"Received August 3rd, worked fine for 4 months of intermittent use, had to replace batteries once. Stopped working. Checked battery in remote "" no problem"", replaced batteries in lamp "" batteries that work in other device"". There is no manual switch to determine if problem is light or remote. Disappointed. No option to return for replacement.",0
"It isn't very bright. If you want to illuminate a diploma, it would be great. No good for normal size paintings. I will eventually find a use for it, but not for the art quilt I was hoping to illuminate.",0
"To small, not enough light.",0
This item is NOT gold it's a copper/orange color with a gold arm. If you are looking for gold to match your decor find a different brand as this is copper in color. Most annoying mislead on a product on Amazon.,0
Looks so cheap with 2 shades of gold,0
Bought this product and after installing it was impressed with the look and options that were programmable from the comfort of my couch. Well it’s only been over a month and now does not operate at all even if you push the on/off switch on the light. Do not purchase without the warranty as you only have 30 days. Probably I’m giving up on battery powered picture lights as they are unreliable,0
I ordered gold and what came is NOTHING like what is pictured. It’s practically orange.,0
Easy to install but tilts down. Battery remote quit too soon and I can’t reach button to do it manually,0
Received this item after ordering another. Worked fine until we needed to replace the batteries in both the unit and remote. Now it will not light at all. The first light still works fine. Reluctant to order another.,0
"We installed the light, tested it. It worked at that time. Not used for even 1 hr collectively and it has stopped working.
Waste of money.",0
"Barely shines a light at all. It doesn't light up the area, can barely tell that the light is on and I had it on at 100%. If you really need a light like this, I would not recommend it.",0
Poor light,0
"Remote control died after first use, as well as the light. Changed the batteries multiple times and it drains quickly and is not bright. Wasn’t satisfied with this purchase. Better off investing in a higher quality light",0
"where is the quality control? Remote wouldn't turn on, lights are unevenly bright, neck doesn't adjust so with my long painting (much longer than it is wide), the light it too bright at the top and doesn't reach the bottom.",0
"The light was not bright enough when it was working, and it did not work for very long. I am NOT happy with it! I am trying to return it now, but the warranty is only for a replacement,. Since it is made in China it probably means the replacement will not be any better!",0
Don’t waste your money on this the plastic is a heinous copper color and looks super cheap the arm is gold but not at all flexible and it doesn’t come down far enough on the picture. I truly don’t understand why they didn’t make the plastic a gold color. Super disappointing piece of junk,0
broke after a few weeks!!!,0
"Batteries go here to die, so you would think at least there would be a reasonably significant amount of light produced. It's nice to look at, easy to install, but the function part of the product name is LIGHT. If you miss that goal, the rest is just window dressing.",0
I love these!,0
"Nice little light, but it died after a couple months. Tried to replace batteries in light and remote with no luck. Tossed in garbage.",0
"I want to brighten up a small, beautiful but dark tapestry. This fixture did not provide sufficient light. Didn't return it as it may do the job for a different artwork.",0
Works well and easy to install but the plastic is not even close to brass colored. It’s a weird copper/orange color. Completely different in color than the curved arm of the light.,0
Drains three batteries every week and the frequency for the remote is the same as a Samsung TV so every time i change the volume on my TV it either flickers the light or turns off completely. Remote doesn't cycle through all light modes only two modes so you still have to manually choose.,0
"Maybe you'll luck out and get a good one. Mine changed it's brightness all on it's own and unless you have the controller in your hand, it isn't supposed to do that.",0
This light was a good choice for our application but it is not bright enough for a larger picture. Unfortunately I will be returning this item.,0
"I have already changed the battery to make sure it wasnt the battery, bit this light stopped working with literally weeks of use. Shame. Do not recommend it",0
Very low brightness,0
"Beautiful design and finish, easy to install
BUT Harsh 3-4 thousand cold Kelvin temperature lighting.
As bad as bluish fluorescent. I would suggest manufacturer change to 2700 Kelvin or less led strips ... they are available in China or allowing the remote to vary the Kelvin temperature to correct this obvious deficiency",0
"it really doesn't light up the picture, is just has a dim halo around the top. Good material and fitment but just not enough light",0
Very low lumix. I bought it to use as a spotlight for a 3x4 poster. Its light is unnoticed. Returned one of 2 pcs I bought.,0
It’s two different colors!! The rod is brass and the actual light is copper. It looks super orangey in real life. I didn’t even bother taking it out of the package it’s so bad. So disappointed,0
"Got this product end of Dec and have already changed batteries twice. Energizer, good batteries not cheapies, and they need changed again. I am so disappointed. For whatever reason this light eats battery juice up so fast, it’s not worth having.",0
The illumination is terrible. Barely lights anything.,0
Too blue and too focused. Need light to be more flood like and less spot like.. returned without a problem.,0
Will not buy again. Over priced plastic with poor install hardware which does not allow proper mount,0
"Like several have written here, this product failed after very little use. I only turned it on infrequently. I changed batteries in both the light and the remote but it no longer functions. Very disappointed in this Amazon Choice product.",0
"Length of battery life and remote fail often! I dependability is not there!
4 purchased 3 are in unreliable",0
"These were supposed to be all one gold color, but it’s half gold and half an orangey shade of rose gold which I think makes it look super cheap. I would not recommend the gold version.",0
Lights stopped working three months later.,0
Don't waste your time with this light. If your picture is bigger than a postcard this light will make little to no difference in the lighting and viewing of a picture. Really poor light output so it's being returned.,0
The only reason I bought them was because it has dimmable setting... however the light resets itself to maximum brightness in less than 30 minutes,0
"It only lit about 6"" of the portrait. Didn't even reach the face",0
"So little light that it is laughable. Unless you have a tiny piece, this will not do the job.",0
"The white lights still work, but the yellow only worked for about 15 minutes. You get what you pay for.",0
The picture is gold but it was copper when it came in the mail. I ordered two and both were copper not gold.,0
"I bought 4 units. They all died completely, even with battery change, within a few months and with very light usage. A complete waste of money and effort.",0
Color of the product does not match the description.. Awful... One part is orange gold and other is yellow gold. Very disappointed.,0
Returned as it was a painted brushed gold plastic finish not quite what I expected.,0
Bought this to accent a photo and antique desk and quite frankly I can barely tell when it is turned on.... It's highlighting nothing!!!. So disappointed!!!! Now the light is not even working .. Can You please comp me a new one... Help,0
Lighting is not bright,0
I haven't even hung this up yet because I need to find a way to correct the hideous color! It is a cheap orange color in person. Definitely not the color depicted in the photo,0
Junk. Absolute junk.,0
"Very cheap looking product, even for price. Plastic is two different tones and very cheaply made. I didn’t even try installing it. Returned!",0
"This is cheap and absolutely not wort it. We bought because of the reviews but in hindsight, the reviews seems fake. The brightness isn't bad but the plastic is clearly bad and looks cheap. Returned the item, would never buy again.",0
Didn’t work out of the box. Could not open the battery compartment on the remote to check if that was the issue. Looked easy enough to install if they had worked. Very cheap looking and much bigger than anticipated. Returned immediately.,0
SO ORANGE!! Not brass like the stock picture shows.,0
It’s not gold but copper. I forgot to read the reviews!,0
It ins't bright enough to illuminate even a small picture.,0
"I bought two. Twice, these lights, after three months, caused the brand new Duracell AA batteries to burst and leak battery acid. This has not happened with any of our many other Duracell battery powered devices.",0
New Batteries burnt out very fast.,0
"I thought this was going to gold, it is orange copper. It looks nothing like the gold in the picture. Had to check to make sure I order the correct color. Says gold, but it’s copper. Returning for sure.",0
The light is not very bright. It does not give a good amount of lighting to the wall. The battery also died very quickly,0
"Remote stopped working within 30 days. Purchased new battery for remote...still not working. This picture light is now, useless!",0
It highlights only about 20% of the painting it was installed above.,0
"This puts out light in a very small area. We have a picture that's 3.5 feet high. It only lights up one-third of the painting. The workmanship is shoddy, which we could deal with if it would do the job.",0
"I order two lights and just put them up , why are the lights different colors one is white and one is yellow. So upset",0
Works fine and looks good. but not outstanding quality. If only metal...would have beengreat,0
Cant really use it. Its just too dim.,0
Dim lighting,0
Light doesn’t last after 3 weeks is very low it’s not good,0
This light is not rechargeable. You need to replace the batteries frequently. This is not as good as the other one I purchased that was rechargeable.,0
We returned both that we ordered. Plugged one in overnight to test it. It wasn't even as bright the next day as the one we didn't plug in! Didn't waste anymore time with them after that.,0
Bought this and just started using less than 10 weeks ago and it stopped working. Tried putting new batteries in and everything - nothing worked.,0
Colour of the actual light is awful. The light and the base are almost orange and the neck is gold.,0
"Light span is no more than 15"" from light.",0
Not at all like the picture. It's not gold. It's more yellowish and it looks soooo cheap. Ugh... what a waste of money,0
"Battery dies quickly, not very bright.",0
This light is not gold. It is metallic burnt orange. Returning.,0
I used to this item for an oil painting. The light is dim the batteries needed to be pushed in a number of times and it’s already out of light. Very disappointed and dissatisfied.,0
Battery is dead after about 3-4 uses. It's a complete joke. I'm throwing them out and getting better ones.,0
Didn’t provide any light for the plaque we used it on,0
"Easy to install, had an orange hue so I had to spray it gold. It looks nice but cheap.",0
"Do NOT buy this product!!! I just paid $13 to
return a defective product because it had been on my wall 3 weeks!
Lights go dim then stop working!!!",0
Good product but very small so doesn’t look good,0
The batteries need replacement in two weeks. Only put on lights a few hours a night. Not happy with this and we have three.,0
"This light barely worked at all. There was very little light from it even before it completely gave up working, and the remote was hit or miss. Very disappointed with this purchase.",0
Horrible color. The stem is a nice good but the battery area and light is a cheap looking orange old plastic . Does not look like photos. Surprised no one has mentioned this,0
The product completely stopped working after 2 months. Batteries were fine. We did not even use it that much during that 2 months. Working on a refund somehow. Product should last longer.,0
"I do not recommend, light is low and batteries run out quickly!",0
Had it less than 1 year and it quit working.,0
Light did not work after third time it was turned on.,0
nice product but the color is awful and doesn’t match. the curved part is gold and shiny and the rest of it is dark copper and matte. not at all like the picture,0
Cheap plastic. Yuk.,0
Feels cheap. Returning.,0
This light arrived without a remote included in the packaging. I’m very disappointed as I will have to return the item now.,0
"Brightness doesn’t last and wasn’t very bright to begin with, even at 100%. Disappointed in my purchase.",0
Three new batteries and it won't turn on.,0
The gold is NOT GOLD. It’s orange and looks terrible!!!,0
I hate it. Not enough light remote is a joke. Only stays on for alittle while. I took it down. Would love to send it back!,0
Feels cheap and looks cheap. Returned.,0
What I saw visually in my head was not the reality I saw on my picture. Not bright- very disappointed.,0
"The quality is very poor. Stopped working after 2 months. Also, the color of the different components don't match.",0
"I liked this a lot, but it stopped working after about three months of use. Disappointing, especially for something you have to install",0
Item has stopped working. Changed the batteries and it still has not resolved the issue,0
"The batteries don't last, the light isn't bright. CHanging batteries don't work. this is a plastic piece of wasted $$ DON'T BUY!!!!!",0
Not bright enough,0
The whole thing apart from the stem is a copper color. Doesn't match if pairing with a gold framed painting.,0
Orange Copper color .Not gold. Hideous . Not at all as described,0
Absolutely junk !! Worked for around 3-4 months then won’t turn on...no customer service would like a replacement ...,0
flikers and is not bright at all. not to mention it is not gold but a cheap looking plastic color gold,0
Very weak lightning and the batteries run out very fast.,0
Stopped working in a week!,0
They last a couple of days,0
"This is yellow. Not gold. It’s the worst color I’ve ever seen and now I’m
Stuck with 2 of them.",0
The only gold about this wall light is the curve pole the rest is not gold.,0
"This item was much smaller than I expected. Now, I have something that I can not use.",0
"Stating that the package is 17"" is deceptive as the lit lengths consist of only two separate 4"" sections",0
Quit working after a week,0
TOO DIM TO DISPLAY A PAINTING AND REMOTE IS TRASH,0
Piece of garbage! Save your money! Did not come with a remote control. Absolutely useless. Unable to reach the seller,0
"Quality very cheap. Should have sent it back, however just threw it away.",0
Poor overall quality - light was extremely dim. Cheap plastic. AVOID!,0
Did not like the copper color it had so I returned it.,0
Its orange. Its really orange . Its going back.,0
Piece of junk!,0
"This was supposed to be gold, but it's a copper color.",0
Missing remote control,0
The brass color was not brass. It looks terribly cheap!,0
"This light is not very bright
Actually a waste of money!",0
Dem,0
Not bright enough.,0
Looks very cheap. Definitely would not recommend,0
Very dim to the point of being useless.,0
We’re disappointed that lighting is a lot weaker than what we expected.,0
Loose connection on switch. Very dull. Returned,0
"Very low quality item,it`s falling apart right in my hands.",0
Battery only lasted two days,0
Looked extremely cheap and like spray painted plastic.,0
Cheap looking - didn't even use it.,0
Made in China,0
No remote,0
Not bright,0
Stopped working after first night,0
Very cheaply made.,0
"I’ve had these lights for about a year and when I tell u I wish I never bought them. Like everyone with a honest review says, it DRAINS the batteries, very quickly. A few hours per night will need new battery change in a week if u want to maintain optimal brightness. How expensive then is this product if you’re constantly buying batteries? The color was an ugly orange/copper so I spray painted it. If they would just paint it a true gold color n fix the evil wiring problem, it might be worth something. DONT BUY!! This product is garbage and wastes so much money.",0
"It does not hold its charge for very long. Maybe an hour. Then starts to die out for last 10min by getting dimmer and dimmer till off. . Then takes long time to recharge again. I would not invest if you are going to use it more than hour Easy to install, nice looking",0
"These lights were just the look I was looking for. It is hard to mount them securely to the wall. The plastic is cheap, batteries are stuck and can't get the last one out to see if the battery is why they are not working. Way too expensive for the quality of the product. Didn't use the remote, easier to just turn it on and off. Worked for a short while and now can't get the battery out to see if that is the issue.",0
quit working after 2-3 years of very little use. changing batteries no help,0
"This thing is trash. It's cheaply made, the set of three lights on either side will reflect on any pane of glass, and the lights contained in the unit are very dim. The white is PALE white and the warm is basically white. I WOULD HIGHLY NOT RECOMMEND BUYING THIS.",0
"Be suspicious of a product that has packaging that says it requires AAA batteries, but when you set it up you will find that it uses AAs. If that was the only problem you could blame human error. However, I was bitten twice by this product. It's design meets our needs perfectly, but design does not overcome cheap materials, put together haphazardly. The first time I bought it through Home Depot and took it back for a refund. I waited a year or so and thought I would try It again -- Stupid!!!!!! It worked for a few days and then nothing. I replaced the new batteries in both the lamp and the controller and still nothing.

Do not buy this junk!",0
"Seriously, 83 five star and only five star reviews, all on the same day? And all in non standard English.",0
"Remote was easy enough but brightness just isn’t enough for the painting only luminates
The top 1/4 of picture",0
"It is way to dim to light up larger paintings,I've tried both switches and ways to dark.Very disapointed",0
"The description says it has an IRON arm, it’s all very cheap plastic. The color is sort of orange, it looks like it will break when you mount it. Not worth the price at all. Weighs nothing,",0
Impossible to open battery compartment.,0
Not bright at all,0
"The description said ""bright"" but it really isn't - I'm returning it",0
"If you were looking for an orange toned gold, this is the one for you. But for the typical faucets and just general gold and an interior, this cold will definitely be way too warm and peachy. Will be returning in hopes of finding another one online that is a better match. The worst part is the anchor/arm that holds the light to the battery pack is the proper gold so it doesn't even match the light itself.",0
ONLY OPERATES WITH BATTERIES AND WILL LAST A FEW HRS TURNED ON,0
"I love the detail and is not expensive and is not heavy but I do not like false marketing if say Gold I want Gold color but this is Bronze, Hello Huuuuugeeee difference! And that is very bad for customer experience! Please team level up and be clear on the Color because now Im in the way to home depot to buy a gold spray !!",0
This is barely a light. They are the worst. The material sucks. You can barely see anything with they. You can see better with a flashlight from your phone.,0
"Bought this a few weeks ago., finally put it up and it lasted one week. There is no difference in the dimming that you can really see. Plus It would cost a fortune in batteries. I do not recommend this.",0
"Disappointed, UPS left out in rain. No idea if they work. They do look nice",0
Light is not bright enough. Not useful for artwork,0
Batteries will only last about 10 days at 6 hours/ day,0
They aren't very bright and they are cheaply made. I sent the ones I ordered back and found a desk lamp that was much brighter and fit my needs much better.,0
Horrible color! Is not the color that is shown in the picture and the arm is not the same color as the rest of the lamp,0
"Is not like the picture; is not good sinking of orange plastic.
The light os also not good. Don’t worth the money.",0
"What a piece of garbage, so many batteries later this does not work at all. Huge fail and disappointment. Of course it is past the return date. If I could give it zero stars I would.",0
Light is not as bright,0
"the brightness is so low. i wanted a direct spot light on top my glitter wall art, so the glitters would sparkle but this spot light brightness is so low didn't make any difference. The pic shows at 100% brightness level set.",0
There was no problem installing it. And it works fine. But if you’re looking for something high end this isn’t it because the base and head are plastic. So only the arm is metal. So I am a little disappointed with the look overall.,0
"Doesn’t work with some antique ornate frames as frame itself is 6” and has depth of 3”. Even mounted as close as possible to top of frame, it still doesn’t work.",0
Was hoping for medal not plastic but looks ok.,0
Like the light...buttons on the remote are stiff to push....,0
I was looking for a cordless picture light and purchased this item. It did not suit the picture and area that we were using it for. When I tried to return it I found out it could not be returned… now I have a $75 light with nowhere to use it.,0
"In the picture the gold colour of the metal and plastic( it’s all plastic except for the bar) are the same...in fact, only the metal bar is the same colour as the advertised item...the plastic is very bright old gold. I am luck that my picture frame can handle this colour above it....it would absolutely not work with a more modern frame or setting.The item is very cheap...the plastic got scratched as I was installing it. I am keeping it because it serves my immediate purpose, but I would certainly not recommend it.",0
"For $68 it is not worth it. The light colour are warm or bright with timers, that’s nice but that’s about it. The “gold” light has a traditional gold neck but the two end pieces are more rose gold, fake plastic which I’ve tried to capture in the photos. I talked to “influencers” who bought this in USA and theirs is much better and for $25. If you’re in Canada do not buy this product unless you’re desperate and maybe buying black as it’ll probably be all the same shade. Definitely going to return, sadly.",0
Purchased this picture light for a picture where there was no access to electricity. Worked fairly well for the first week or two but went through batteries very quickly. Then it simply stopped working. Changed the batteries in the light and the remote. Still nothing. Terrible product at a ridiculously high price.,0
"Luxway picture light, remote does not work, very disappointing, the time I have tried new batterys and try to fix it is crazy, please send me a new remote that works. Thank you Terry Todd",0
"With limited placement options, there is a strong lighting glare for paintings under glass, and I would not recommend this item for those uses.",0
"Tiene una iluminacion muy baja, la puse para resaltar un cuadro, y no funciono, ahora esta como puro adorno arriba del cuadro",0
I liked the looks and color but now what do I do with the burned out section,0
"La lampe n'est pas assez efficace, et le retour de la lampe chez le fournisseur nous coûte plus de 30% du coût d'achat. Donc pensez y bien sérieusement avant de faire une commande.",0
