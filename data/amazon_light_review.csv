"We put this on a stone fireplace above a special piece of art. We thought it would be difficult because of the uneven surface of the stones, but it worked! The template helped a LOT!

Nice light with warm or cool options, bright or dimmer. The ONLY complaint I have is that the longest timer setting is just two hours. Wish it were longer.",1
I’m OBSESSED with this art lamp!!! My father in law surprised us with a painting of our wedding venue for Christmas and this lamp gives it just the spotlight it deserves!!! It added so much to our display and I am so pleased with this product! Super easy to install- is super lightweight and even has a little build in level for perfect installation! Love the added touch of the remote and the different settings. Can be set to cool or warm light and can adjust the brightness as well as set timers for automatic shut off! BUY THIS!,1
"For a 16 x 24 canvas it might be enough, but mine was 20 x 45 and not enough light.",1
"You can attach those with a 3M “sticker”. Love that they come with a remote that has a timer.
Super cute and have no cons about them.",1
Great light a little challenge to hang up but built in level helps. Only complaint is the lack of communication with seller if your light comes broken just send back and reorder seller does not respond to you.,1
"I have metal ones in my living room and they work great but were expensive and difficult to install. This one is made of mostly plastic but you almost can’t tell. You would have to get up close and even then it is difficult. I just installed it so I can’t say how long the batteries last. But I don’t intend to keep it on constantly as I don’t the metals one. The remote is great; allows you to turn on/off; dim; timer and change type of lighting. For the price, this one can’t be beat!",1
I like the chrome design and simplicity of this light. It tends to suck away battery power really quickly. Having to put in new batteries is really easy cause you can flick it off the wall. Note: you cannot move this from left to right. It is in a fixed position but you can move the lights up and down. I love the look it makes for my paintings and the remote is cool to change from warm light to led. I wish it had better battery life.,1
Great if you can’t hardwire and are ok with led light!,1
"I’m not one to rewrite reviews much, but the manufacturer of this product thought of everything. I was thoroughly impressed with the paper that they used to help guide the install of the screws, which were provided. Also, remote control is outstanding with a bunch of options. (One suggestion to the manufacturer, maybe they can add a dusk dawn timer instead of just 120 minutes on the timer). Lastly, the lights themselves rotate so you can place the lights where you want them on your painting.
Thank you so much for making such quality product.",1
"These lights are great for pictures that are not near a wall outlet. The versatility in light brightness, color, and timer make this a great purchase. It was VERY easy to install (has a level on the mounting plate). The lights rotate which allow you to adjust where the light shines. Bought one to try first, then bought another!",1
Easy to install and beautiful! Perfect amount of light over my art in the powder room! Also adds a beautiful glow in a dark room!,1
"My office is a box with no windows. Thanks to this product, I'm able to have 2 more alternative forms of light highlighting the art I pretty much can never see without migrane-inducing, godless flourescent lighting! Thanks LUXSWAY and Amazon!!",1
This light is amazing. I bought it to see my clock in the night when I am in bed. All I have to do is use my remote control to turn it on or off.,1
"Perfect for my hallway. So cute, and easy to install and use. I used some 3M tapes to install it on my wall, no drilling. Viola! Gonna buy a bunch more for some art work around the house.",1
"A designer on YouTube recommended this light so I thought I’d try it. For the price, it’s a great light. Looks nice on the wall. Highly recommend it.",1
Hubby always wants to know how I come up with these type of things. It's a perfect addition to my living area. We placed it over our anniversary picture going up the stairs. Batteries last long and i like the different brightness it provides depending on mode.,1
This light is exactly as described and I'm using in a darkish corner to highlight an oil painting.,1
"I bought one of these wanting to not only light a painting but to dress up my wall as well. Not only does my painting look better with the added light, but the area looks far more professional than I dreamed. The light added instant class and upped the focus of the room. It was easy to install and comes with a remote that’s user friendly to use and works well from across the room. I would definitely recommend this light. I bought it in black for Halloween, but because it’s easy to install and remove, I’m ordering gold for Christmas.",1
"Beautiful light, so easy to install has so many different lighting options. Obsessed!",1
"I like how easy to install and beautiful lights..
Highly recommended.",1
Very easy to install and looks amazing.,1
Very easy to install.,1
"I purchased 3. Easy to install. 2/3 work perfectly. The 3rd one lights do not function properly. The first time I turned on for 1 hour and it worked great. The second time I wanted to use, the lights turned on but not fully, then would completely cut off after 10 minutes. 30 minutes later would turn back on and then off again. Swapped for new batteries, still the same thing. There must be a short.",1
"No wires, easy install, reasonable price",1
"I love everything about this portrait light. It was easy to install. The back plate detaches and has a built-in level, so hanging it straight is fool-proof. The remote allows you to set timer options, warm/cool light tone, and brightness. I will definitely be buying more!",1
Made my living room look so upscale. In love,1
"This was super easy to install and get set up. The remote controls are a little finicky but honestly I’m not turning them off/on very often.

It doesn’t emit a lot of light but is perfect for the gallery wall set up.",1
This changed the game for highlighting a painting in my hallway and especially love the timer function (though I wish there was more than 2-hour option). Also easy to change the battery. Make your place look fancy like an art gallery!,1
It’s very easy to put together and use and I do like the remote control but it’s nowhere near as bright as I thought it would be and it doesn’t really illuminate a large painting.,1
"The light it gives off isn’t very soft, but it looks nice for the price.",1
"The IR sensor is positioned so it's facing backwards. I had my doubts about the correctness of this. But somehow they got it to work , with the sensor facing in the opposite direction. The IR beam of the remote evidently is being reflected off of the base battery into the sensor. I think it still would've work just as good or even better if the sensor was facing forward . But the designer appears to be going for aesthetics, preferring a smooth continuous profile with the sensor hidden away. They rely on bouncing the beam into the sensor. The timer is just a interval type count down timer. It's not a day/ night type thats turned on and off by room light level. A minus I think.",1
It’s plastic but doesn’t feel too cheap. Take proper measurements before installing it,1
"Love the look. Sits a little crooked (leans forward) as it’s top heavy, even though I used the paper template and followed the directions. Comes with wall anchors but it’s not heavy enough to need them; plus my drywall is so thin, which could be why it’s leaning forward, that the anchors just went straight into the wall and disappeared. Maybe someone will find it 100 years from now like a love letter. “Dear drywall…”",1
Beautiful absolutely gorgeous,1
"I used a clear command strip to hang, so that I didnt have to damage the walls, so installation was a breeze. I used it in my foyer, and it adds so much character to a plain canvas painting, and for such a small price. Also adds subtle ambient light acting like a nightlight when all other lights are off. Ill be ordering a couple more for my living room.",1
Love the look! Easy to install and gives a great look. I’ll probably buy more for other areas of the house.,1
" I love everything about the way this looks. Only issue I have is the batteries. The batteries die in a couple days if you forget to turn it off.

Don’t waste your money. Just buy a rechargeable version.",1
"I needed a light for a tintype photo that was too dark and this is perfect. It was very easy to install except I ended up using nails with a larger head as I did not have the ability to use the enclosed screws. I love that the light heads can be rotated to the exact position you need as well as the fact that there are 3 different choices for lighting (6 white LED lights, 6 warm white LED lights or the combination of 12) and that there is a remote control! Also, the color is fine. It is described as orangey (which it is not) and someone else had said a brushed gold would be preferrable (which it is).",1
"I had my doubts about these... I knew that the paintings in corner of my den needed some lighting, but the thought of having a cord hanging down the wall was untenable to me. Cutting in two outlets on the wall behind the paintings could be easily accomplished, but if the paintings ever came down, the outlets would have had to be removed. This installation remains a possibility.

In the meantime, these lights serve to reinforce the notion that this corner needs lighting. They were simple to install, taking less than 10 minutes each. The lighting modes offer more variety than most plug in lights, and the dimming feature allows you to both extend battery life while adjusting to the lighting needs of the moment. The timer feature is also useful for extending battery life. It turns off what I forgot.

There is a clever little bubble level integral to the mounting bracket that made the installation that much easier. The only adjustment that I had to make was in the field of light coming from the unit. The lights throw a full 180 degrees of light, which resulted for me in light shining above the paintings and frames and onto the wall. I remedied this by placing electrician's tape across the upper section of the lens of the light. Depending on the size of your piece, you may want to similarly adjust the range of lighting. This modification does not show in the room.

I found that mounting it as close to the frame as possible was the best placement for the light. Mounting it above the frame resulted in highlighting the space between the frame and the lights' base.

To sum up, the light is inexpensive, easily installed, versatile, and effective. I can enthusiastically recommend it to anyone who finds himself wanting to light up a framed piece of artwork without undertaking a small home wiring project.",1
" What an affordable way to elevate the look of your home! Easy to install, remote is small and discreet, with a timer",1

"This arrived ahead of time, and was very easy to install for a large painting we have.",1
 Easy to install... I used 3m double sided tape & that did the trick. It really makes the painting pop. Very happy with it !!,1
"Easy to install, just the right light. Love love love it. Makes the print look elegant, I think.",1
"We were looking to add decor to a living room wall. Decided on three vertical pictures with the wireless pictures light over them. Just love it! The color, light, size is perfect!",1
 A great little light to add accent to a hall way,1
Love these for the aesthetic but not super bright If that’s what you’re looking for,1
The remote has to be pointed at the light to operate. Serves it purpose. A little over priced but what isn’t now days,1
"The fixture looks great, I read in several reviews that the fixture had a orange hue but I'm guessing they have improved and fixed that problem bc the fixture looks gold as shown in the picture.",1
"This is so much nicer than I thought it would be, and at a terrific price. Installation was a snap. I bought two and will definitely get more. This is a really great cordless solution for smart looks and occasional use.",1
Just perfect over one of my favorite oils. It looks expensive but it’s not!!!,1
" I like that you can dim and change the brightness of the the lights. I like soft white and at 50% at night. The remotes work in this odd space by the stairs, I was was impressed they worked from the top of the stairs. I love this product. Sorry the video is so long, I recorded it for my sister to show her and couldn't trim to post here.",1
This was super easy to install and I love how it looks. The plate on the back has a self-leveling tool making it error proof for me. Popped in 3 AA batteries and it is up. Easy to take down to change batteries when needed. I like how you can set a timer with the remote. Highly recommend.,1
"Absolutely love these! Fast one day shipping and I was able to easily hang these in my home office!
There is a 'leveler' included with the mounting piece and the fact that you slide the main light onto this allows for easy, no fuss, no mistake installation. Went from package to wall over my pictures in my office in less than 30 mins for all three lights and pictures!
Well worth it and I love the fact the lights are remote controlled so I just point click, dim or change the color and I'm done. Will add a photo later! Thanks",1
These lights are good priced and instantly elevated our space. Super easy to install and was happy to find out one remote will work for both lights,1
LOOKS GREAT,1
Love the remote control. I did purchase two and they both come with their own control but one control turns both on. It had two settings for a cool white light or a yellow light. Just what I was searching for.,1
Love this product. It arrived exactly like the photos. Was very easy to install. Takes 3 AAA Batteries. The remote requires a button battery. (just saying that for those who don't. like keeping button batteries in their homes with kids),1
"Not too bad, just wish it was brighter & the rod was gooseneck adjustable. I don’t plan on using this for a picture light.",1
Love it!,1
"First of all, if you are looking to light up a super expensive piece of art I would assume you are not looking to buy this light. However, I purchased this light because i do have several pieces of art that are moderately expensive and my house has terrible lighting to say the least. I bought one light to see how well it works and i will be buying more for my other paintings. It is rather inexpensive and easy to install. It does a good job lighting up my art but again is not a professional light. There are 2 light modes but i prefer the white light and the remote is super helpful as i installed this high enough i would need a ladder to turn it on and off. Another really great thing is that you can set a timer on the remote so that the light auto turns off so you do not burn through batteries. I recommend this product and will be buying more.",1
"Great little light! Super easy to install and was impressed with the built in level on the hanging bracket. I’ve only had it for a day so
I can’t speak to longevity, but so far it works great. Awesome purchase for the price.",1
I used 3m command strips and stuck these on top of ikea billy bookcases. It looks so fancy. But when you turn them on they are LED which always sorta reminds me of a bug zapper.,1
Works great and lights up my photo great,1
,1
"There’s absolutely nothing negative to say about this lighting. Super easy to set up, literally it took me two minutes. It looks amazing at night. I am not one to right reviews but sometimes you should. You will thank me later. It looks expensive, very good material. Don't hesitate to get it.",1
 I used it to help elevate my mirrors on my wall and it did what needed to be done!,1
Super easy to mount. The remote control is such a plus also. I can turn it on and off without much effort. If I could add one thing it would be to offer a more muted gold.,1
I really like this light! It looks sharp and provides perfect lighting that you can turn up or sun. Make white or warm etc.,1
Installed in a dark corner over a picture that I treasure,1
"This product looks great and is inexpensive. However, be prepared to change batteries often. If you purchase, only turn on when company is over. If you want an everyday painting light (or have a large painting), consider another product.",1
"Absolutely love this light!
It’s lightweight and easy to install. Love that it comes with a paper template so you know where to make the pilot holes.
The remote control works well. I like a warmer light, not bright LED. So love that I’m able to change the warmth and brightness.
Will be buying more for my home.
If you’re looking for an inexpensive art light that works well, look no further!",1
These are great. I wish they came in a more aged gold color but the yellow gold works fine. The remote doesn’t work from far away which sucks but overall we are happy with them.,1
Wasn’t sure how they would look as lighting for my bedroom but they worked out great. They make my room look cozy and ambient. Would love to use them elsewhere.,1
Love this so much! I wanted a light above my mantle but didn’t want to deal with electrical. This was the perfect solution. The gold was really really shiny gold so I took a craft paint brush and brown acrylic paint and went over it a little so it looked like aged brass.,1
"Es muy fácil de instalar...prro en mi caso los tornillos que trajo no sirvieron...tiene un nivel incorporado lo que hace que el trabajo sea más fácil...el brillo, el control remoto todo muy bien...Definitivamente es un plus no tener que hacer obra para los cables. Lo recomiendo ciento x ciento.",1
"Was not as bright as I thought, but looks good in the foyer",1
"I love this picture light. The only problem I had was nailing it to the wall above my Bachelor of Arts degree. It appears that my wall is not cooperating with the hammer and nails. It keeps bending. I think I would have to buy a drill and secure it like that. All and all I was able to place it on a table near the frame and let the light shine upon it. LOL , hey its cool. What I didn't like was the remote control. It appears to be difficult to open and to operate. We can't open the small case to see what type of batteries are needed. Bummer!. However, I love, love, love the picture light and will buy it again for all my other degrees and certificates. It really is a great help in highlighting one's own personal achievements. It sells at a great and affordable price too.",1
Anyone can install this lamp in 5 min! Looks very elegant. The remote control is a big plus as well as the batteries ... no electric cable connection required!,1
Our Peter Max picture is highlighted perfectly,1
Good to install,1
" I literally love everything about this. I can’t stand bright white light. The control let’s you use warm light, gives a dimmer option as well as a timer option. If you use the button on the light itself, it gives you a “mixed” option which is shown in my photo and video. It’s also incredibly easy to install. There is a level (the measuring stick with the leveling bubble) that makes installing as easy as can be. I loved it so much I bought another, then my parents saw it and had me purchase several for them as well. My dad is an artist and very particular with the artwork he has on display. If you have a large painting I would use 2, but it’s perfect for what I have. Also, bonus, one remote works for all of them so you can keep one for backup if you have several in the same room like I do.",1
"Good value! Can’t beat the price and it works well. Like other reviews said, the color is definitely a more orange gold. The middle metal part is yellow gold. Then the base and the hood around the light is plastic and a more orange almost brass color. I wanted a more settle gold so I spray painted it and it came out good. Very easy to install and sturdy. I would use the screws it comes with. I used the correct command strips at first and it fell pretty soon after. With the screws though it’s all set! I would have given it five stars if the color matched the pictures better and if it was all an even color",1
"Until you add it to your pictures, canvas, or portraits. Evaluated my living look",1
Works great !!! Love it !!,1
 I just finished installing these built in gallery bookcases and wanted a library light to finish them off! I needed a battery operated option until I have electricity run. These are the perfect inexpensive solution and they look great! I love how easy they were to install! Literally under 5 min! They have a remote that works on both of them! I love that they offer a warm or cool light that can be dimmed! I love the black option! I also purchased the gold and was less impressed with the finish! The gold was very orange but I think I may keep still and spray paint to use in a powder room. I’m overall very very happy with how these look and operate… and you can’t beat the price!!!,1
Great quality for the price. Easy install and looks great.,1
Lamp is super easy to install and has nice features like 2 different light levels and a remote control. This product would be 5 star if the built in timer did more than simply turn the lamp off. It would be great if the timer could be set to come on daily at a specific time and remain on for a set period then turn off. Many decorative cordless lights have this feature.,1
"So easy to install, looks great, adjustable light",1
"This light was well made, easy to install, and has good light output. There's a built in timer to automatically shut off the light after a predetermined time interval, and battery life is good",1
It looks great hopefully won’t die on me,1
Love this light for over my picture! Easy to use and just the right amount of ambience,1
"This was a great solution for someone who doesn't want to mess with having to plug in a picture light. Although the parts are plastic and the curved arm does not match the light display piece or the mounting piece, at a distance it isn't really too obvious. Also, as another reviewer noted, the brass version is tinged in the orange direction, but as yet another reviewer noted, it is probably an option to tape over the light band and lightly spray the entire piece with a gold spray, thereby toning down the orange and creating a common color for all three parts. I might try that at some point, but my picture light is at a distance, so the tones don't particularly bother me. Otherwise, great features, good lighting, well done for the price!",1
,1
"These are very nice. The only reason that I didn't give them 5 stars is because the arm of each of the lights is just slightly off center, and there doesn't appear to be a way to straighten it without breaking the unit, so I just let it. It's not so noticeable that I needed to return it, but just annoys my OCD.",1
Looks really pretty and easy to install.,1
"I use this light in my theater room to illuminate the popcorn area. It's great. I was planning on using this above a really nice framed poster in the room but the light did look a little cheap next to the nicely framed image. So moving it over to the popcorn area it fit way better over there and had better function.

The light is really bright in our dark room. I keep it at around 10% brightness and it's the perfect strength needed. 100% is really bright for a room with low lights. The battery life has been great especially since I keep the lights so low.

I do not like the remote. It is typical for lights like this. I can see it breaking at some point which will be a problem but just hoping it lasts. You do have to be really close to use it. Like 1 foot away from the light.

For my purposes this is perfect.",1
"Love this light! Easy to hang, as it has a built in level. This was PERFECT!",1
Excellent light. Gives a good glow and lights the pics up very nicely! Not sure how long the battery lasts but it has been 2 weeks and it is still working! Plus it has a remote control and it can switch off after 2 hours! Highly recommend this when you don’t want to hard wire.,1
"This is a first time for us illuminating original art. The lamps work beautifully, they are easy to adjust
We highly recommend this product",1
Perfect to show case our family flag in our living room. Love you can adjust the brightness and angle and even the color hue. I'd buy this again,1
"This has exceeded my expectations! Gold is a little brassy gold but not terrible and goes with the gold accents in my home. I am just laughing so hard at this! Plus, the back plate slides off so you can easily install and not have to fight lining up the holes. A+",1
"Very happy with this purchase. I knew going into it this was not a high quality light for a painting, but I needed something inexpensive for now and this does the trick! To be honest, I was lazy and did not have the tools to actually mount it on to the painting , so I simply laid it over the top and it anchored itself quite nicely over the back, and being so lightweight it worked out perfectly! Now I only did this because it’s a temporary fix until I get the tool to mount it properly, and because of this it doesn’t distribute the light as evenly as it will when it’s mounted to the frame. However, I’m impressed with how well it works, and the remote is great, you control everything , dimmer, timer, warm light/ cool light from the remote that seems to have about a10 ft range. Up close it’s a little cheap looking as some reviews have stated, but once it’s mounted on the frame it looks just fine. My brother was so impressed he also bought one. I highly recommend 😁",1
I wanted a light to brighten my dark gallery corner but have no outlets in the area. This picture light solved my dilemma and illuminates Sadko perfectly. It’s inexpensive and effective. I’ll be buying another!,1
" So this picture light is beautiful. I bought 3 of them and one of the 3 didn’t work, so a new one was sent to me and it actually worked this time around. Beautiful lights with different settings. I love it",1
" Perfect! Exactly as pictured! The dimmer is a amazing feature and the remote works from a good amount of distance. It's perfect in the morning when you are half awake and don't want a bright light, but just enough to see especially since I have blackout curtains. The transition of the dimmer doesn't show as well in the video, but it is very smooth. The hanging process was so quick and easy! The back plate has a built in level which allowed me to hang it perfectly straight and in just minutes. It comes with everything you need in order to hang. My last 2 pics shows the different hues, the 1st being the warm setting and the 2nd being the cool setting. I Love it!",1
"I wanted to create a cozy ambience in my classroom, but keep it looking classy. This light did just that!",1
" Extremely pleased with how simple the install was. No hardwiring needed. There is a back plate that slides off with holes for each screw, after you screw the plate to the wall, the light fixture slides on the plate nice and snug. I used a level when installing. The remote has 3 different light options: blue, warm, and a mixture of blue/warm. It is dimmable and there is a timer option that I use at night as I’m going to bed. The gold color is a little on the orange gold color versus yellow gold but it still looks nice. The light can swivel as well as twist up or down depending on where you want the light reflected on. Really happy with this product and makes my canvas paintings I made stand out.",1
I love everything about it,1
I selected the gold color. Very elegant and lights up my painting perfectly. I really like the multiple choices in lights and the way the arm swivels. I am going to purchase more for the rest of my paintings. Highly recommend this product.,1
"SO easy to mount, so worth the price! I definitely didn’t love the gold at first. The arch is a nice gold, and the rest of the fixture is a bronzey gold that’s a little on the orange side. I really wanted to make this work. It was either this or the black because I definitely wanted to mount these. I gave it a chance and the color is NOT an issue for me anymore. The remote and settings are super convenient and easy to use. Very pleased with this purchase!! No complaints here at all.",1
"Cute and affordable but looks cheap up close. I may spray paint it a softer gold in the future, but for now it serves its purpose. You get what you pay for so I am not too upset about it looking plastic-y and cheap. It works well but most importantly, it looks really sharp above a frame (from a distance Lol). Would still purchase again!",1
So easy to install and they compliment my office bookcases beautifully,1
"We love this light w no cords hanging
Remote control so good
Looks wonderful over art work
Fit our painting perfectly
I would order another one!",1
"I’m so glad I purchased these! Affordable price, doesn’t look cheap (from afar), and offers a range of settings for brightness and direction. Exactly what I was looking for to help make my narrow hallway cozy without turning on all of my ceiling lights for longer hours.",1
I loved this so much I ordered another one. After a few days the first one I ordered stopped working. It would only go to about 30%. When I explained that I didn’t want to take the back plate off the wall for fear of damage I got in touch with Amazon and they are sending me a replacement!! I’m happy because the light is really great and does a good job lighting my artwork along a dark hallway. The fixture itself is somewhat subdued and doesn’t detract from the pieces of art it’s illuminating. It was super easy to hang and I’m just hoping they will not all stop working after a few days. If they continue to work I plan on buying one for all my artwork!,1
Easy to install and use,1
"Didn't want to buy it but my wife was insistent. I thought it looked cheap, but it's actually pretty cool once we received it.",1
"I am thrilled with this light--so many adjustments, you're bound to like some of them! No cord (I don't plan to have it on all the time, so battery life is not an issue). You do need to understand that the ""gooseneck"" on the lamp doesn't flex--so you can swivel it back and forth but not up and down. And the lights themselves can be adjusted. Well made, and looks great. I'll try to add a picture later...",1
"These are so great. I searched high and low for some sconces to go in the molding of a built in bookshelf. I kept running into the issue that either the doors would hit the light when they opened or the sconce would hit the ceiling. I also didn’t have the capability to wire lights. Enter these lights. I LOVE them. They fit the 8 inch space I had to work with perfectly, they have multiple light/dimness settings, they’re easy to install, and use. Now the neck is absolutely a different color. It’s a brassy yellow gold. However, I used Antique Gold Rub’n Buff and it worked like a charm. I’m very pleased with these!",1
The product was delivered timely. It looks great. It was east to install. There are options of light choices for you particular artwork or where it hands. The remote is east to use and works well. I am very happy with my purchase,1
"Arrived early and in excellent shape. The product description is accurate except for one thing. It is better than described. This is my first picture light so maybe I am just ignorant of these things. I am impressed. This light makes the picture pop. I had to place my picture in a dark area of the room. It becomes the focal point with this light.
The product appeared to be cheap because it was very light but its weight is misleading. This was easy to install properly with the provided template.
The remote control is awesome. You can change the color of the light and the brightness.. The timers are real battery savers.",1
,1
"I bought this unit for a medium size painting. The remote control unit worked as expected but the on/off button on the unit did not function. I wish the light were brighter, but it is after all a battery unit. When mounted on the wall the copper color didn't look right with my decor. So I bought some Sharpie jumbo sized markers (black) and carefully ""painted"" the entire unit with them. It looks fine now and doesn't distract the eye from the painting.",1
"Most importantly, I found the following features bring pleasure in viewing my recent purchase: The Guardian.
1) wireless. Runs on 3 AA batteries (not included)
2) miniature level and paper template for determining placement of screws for the panel which the light easily slides
3) remote with option for bright white or amber lightening. Plus ability to brighten or dim
4) timer for auto off as I gaze before sleeping
5) one can actually rotate the lights 180 degrees as to where the light shines on art piece
I am very pleased and will order again for future pieces.",1
"It really is!! It replaced a huge clunker of a light that took FOUR D-size batteries and I had to virtually disassemble the whole thing to replace them. This is a nicely made, almost delicate fixture that looks great even when it's not on. We hung it in maybe five minutes and I can see how easy it will be to replace the THREE AA batteries when it's time.
The remote works great with a number of available settings, but we wish the light on any setting could be just a tad brighter (wouldn't recommend for a dart board). A VERY good, attractive product at an extremely reasonable price.",1
I must have over any great picture,1
Easy to install. Lights can changed to yellow or white. Best of all they have a timer.,1
"This was so easy to install that it blew my mind. I love it's sleek design. It's not as bright as I would like, but it's still a great ad to my portrait that's in a dark corner. I'm very happy with this purchase and recommend this as a good buy!!",1
"I had a tiny bit of trouble thinking I could use command strips or smaller thumbtacks instead of the included screws. Just use the screws. The lighting has a warm or white setting, as well as different length timers. You'll need 3 AA batteries for the unit. The remote control came with a coin battery already in it. I was using some cheap plastic thing that went off every few minutes before, and now this looks like a nice upgrade.
Now if I can just upgrade my darn carpet to hardwoods, it'll look really nice upstairs ; )",1
"I ended up not using this for what I wanted to use it for, but what little I did use it, it worked well. The light is strong and adjustable and it mounts pretty firmly. It's nice to light up a painting. It won't be able to do much for super big paintings though, so keep that in mind. If you want to give even lighting on a large painting you'll need to get something more heavy duty. For a normal size painting that doesn't need exact lighting, though, this is nice.",1
Exelent quality fast delivery exelente description and communications,1
"I love my picture light. It's really pretty and does a great job of lighting my art. It is also offered at an affordable price. The company, Luxsway, also has great customer service! I had an issue and they gave me help freely and quickly, even though I was past the return date. I like this company a lot and will be buying from them in the future! Good people, good product!",1
Love this little light! It looks so cute and it only took a sec to install. The light can be a white light or a warmer tone. You can dim it and put it on a timer. The fixture is easy to get off & change the batteries if need be. The “gold” tone looked a little orange so I did as other buyers did & spray painted it with some gold spray paint. Turned out great. Works via remote or a button on the device. Accidentally ran the remote through the washer & it still works. Yay!,1
Muy practico su uso e instalacion,1
Used these lights to highlight a picture and I also use them when I gave theses shelves a facelift! The lights are remote and can be dimmed. A beautiful finishing touch!,1
"This was a perfect solution to highlight a painting I have that does not get a lot of light. Easy to install and nice looking. Options for warm white light or white light and 50% or 100% intensity are also nice. Light angle is adjustable as well and the remote is perfect for a space that has no outlet. Casing is plastic and somewhat on the cheap side so I hope it lasts. One note that may be the fault of Amazon shipping and the USPS delivery person. I gave specific shipping instructions to leave at my door, with info on entering my gated property. The package was left outside my gate in the weather and it does not appear any attempt was made to deliver it to my door. I'm lucky it wasn't stolen.",1
These are great for the price! Dimmable and you can choose warm white vs the stark look of LED. They came with a template for screws so it was impossible to mess up the placement. Very happy with these!,1
It looks amazing. I wish the brightness was a light higher.,1
It’s a perfect way to upgrade any picture frames or art work.,1
The lights were easy to install and easy to use. The remote works instantly to provide accent lighting without the difficulty of hardwire.,1
"This is just what I was looking for. I wanted to light up a framed picture and there was no easy way to get power to the place. This went up very easily and is easy to remove for battery replacement. It has multiple brightness levels and selectable light tones from whiter to bluer. It remembers the settings, even when the batteries are changed. I have it on for about 3 hours a night and the batteries (3-AA) last between 2 and 3 weeks. Cheaper than an electrician. I wish the remote had more range, I have to stand very close to use it. But there is a switch on the side which can be used instead. One gripe, don't trust the paper template they give you to drill the mounting screws. It's off. Use the base plate itself for your template.",1
Also like the versatility of different settings and dim control. Remote is convenient. Good buy.,1
These were so easy to install. Installed all 3 within 10 minutes. They have a built in level and the lights pop on and off for easy battery change. Adds a sophisticated look for cheap! Highly recommend.,1
Gift for my daughter’s boyfriend. He loves it.,1
A flexible neck rather than one that is rigid and fixed would be helpful.,1
These lights are exactly what I was looking for. Very easy to hang & work perfectly!,1
Very easy to use. Much more convenient than a wired picture light if you have furniture below the picture. Really like having the ability to use the remote to control lighting intensity. Good color rendition.,1
"The light output color has two options, one is more of a blue(ish) typical LED color look. The other is a softer, more halogen look, although my personal preference would be for it to be a bit more yellow.

Also, my unit is slightly crooked. It's mounted straight, but the lamp itself is either slightly bent or just built crooked. Not super noticeable at a glance, but the more you look at it, the more you realize its misshaped.",1
"I used this to highlight a new piece of art I recently purchased. I looked into many different styles and varying price points and this was perfect. Looks very expensive but the price was perfect. I would rather spend my money on the artwork and not a light. It was easy for my husband to mount just took a couple minutes to hang and I love the fact I can adjust the 3 colors - a bright white, warm gold and a combination of the 2. There is a timer as well. I love that it is battery operated and can easily be turned on and adjusted via remote. It is modern looking and has the same features as the 200 and 300 dollar models I saw on other sites. The color matches the frame beautifully. I am very pleased with this purchase and would definitely purchase this light again.",1
I love this little lamp! It's a great way to elevate a little corner of your space....especially if renting since it does not require hardwiring. My only complaint is that the batteries have to be changed quite often to keep the light on and noticeably bright...But the batteries are simple enough to change.,1
"Bought this for my dartboard, and it works pretty well. Easy to install and it actually looks pretty nice despite being plastic. My only gripe is that the light was crooked and didnt line up with the base - they weren't perfectly parallel with each other. So my husband and I had to clamp the bar and manually bend it a few millimeters to straighten it out. Other than that I'm happy with the purchase and is worth the price.",1
This was easy to install & looks amazing. I love that it’s battery operated so I didn’t have to hook anything up. It’s also a great price comparatively.,1
Super cute. It added a nice touch to my wall case. Easy to install. I did not have to wait 12-20 months for my husband to install it either.,1
This is the most handsome picture light I have ever used. It lights up my painting with a soft dim light. Controls work perfectly. Very easy to install with few tools needed. This doesn’t emit a bright light (1 lumen) onto the picture. The manufacturers need to work on that. My light came a little crooked so I had to send it back so check on alignment when you receive you product. That should be corrected before shipping.,1
Very easy install,1
I bought this for a 32x48 and it is definitely not bright enough. The LED's used are on the cheap end so not worth $40 because its all plastic and probably made for $2 in China.,1
"This was so easy to install. But more importantly, it looks great and the price was reasonable. Purchased it to go over a painting of my daughter's wedding. Perfect addition to her new home! Would definitely recommend and will buy again.",1
Easy to install. Looks great.,1
Nice but remote doesn’t do all 3 settings. It just does cool and warm. I like that the light housing is adjustable and can be turned out to spread the light more.,1
"These work well. I love that there is a timer. Also, I didn’t realize I much prefer the warm light to the bright light for viewing paintings. I have 2 artworks that are about 32” to the bottom and not quite bright enough to the bottom. I have 2 other similar light that are only white light and no timer and paid twice as much. If you have a drill, laser level and measuring tape - installs in minutes. I actually used other wall anchors and screws because the included ones are somewhat small. If you used daily it would require a lot of batteries and may want to consider rechargeable. Not sure, but guessing 20 hrs life with 3 AAA batteries",1
"This product works very well. It illuminates my large oil painting (30” h by 40” w). Remote has quite a few settings to choose from in terms of warm/cold light, brightness and timer. I would definitely purchase this again for other paintings.",1
"OK. I have a map of the Territory of Arizona 1880 framed all nice and stuff. I have it in the hallway. This light takes it from merely great, to Outstanding. I have a nice magnifying glass stationed nearby. With this yellow light feature I can study my map in pleasing light in the intensity of my choosing.
I pester every repairman and delivery person with my new light and they are to a man; astounded.
Gotta buy some more cool art as an excuse to buy some more of these fine lamps
Oh the lights are adjustable on the stalks, you can aim them at different areas of your artwork.
Nice feature",1
Love the remote capabilities and love how these look on my gallery wall! Very happy with this purchase!,1
Perfect! My only complaint is that it’s slightly more orange/copper then gold but otherwise it’s perfect and worth the money. The remote has a time which is amazing and the light can be dimmed as well. There are three different light color options.,1
"These lights cast beautiful bright white light on my paintings, and make cheap paintings from the local discount store look much more like art. The only problem is that they operate on three AA batteries, and the light dims pretty quickly. I would say, that after three days of three of four hours of use, the batteries need to be changed out, which is pretty inconvenient.",1
,1
 Love these lights. Easy to put up. Love that I can put a timer on and go to bed.,1
"I stumbled across these lights and knew they needed a home above my gallery wall. The black it perfect and the remote control makes it so you can have it emit light without hardwiring them in.
The lights have cool and warm light so you can decide which you like best. I am really happy with them.",1
These lights are so gorgeous!! It’s a must buy!,1
"I like everything about it but the difference in colors - the only metal part is the curved bar and that’s a gold paint while the rest is more of a rose gold - but overall I’m very satisfied with my purchase, looks really great and you can’t beat the price! Very easy to install: measure, mark, drill, screws, done! The remote and all the functions is amazing!",1
,1
"I like the 15 min - 2.5 hr timer. I can just forget about it and not run down the batteries. I use rechargeables, and they seem to have a long run time.",1
I like this light but the two tone gold color was not what I was looking for. So I sprayed it with Rust-Oleum pure gold paint and I love it.,1
 Me encanto,1
I did need bigger screws to get the mount to stay. The light is top heavy. Looks great & easy to install.,1
"I will be buying more of these for other pieces, I love it. Very easy to install, light weight & I LOVE the remote control with all of the lighting options! This needlework I did looks a little wonky & crooked cause I carried it around for 40+ years unfinished, finally finished it & matted it with handmade papyrus & thought it deserved special lighting. It's my 1st & last needlepoint, so tedious....lol",1
Love this light! It took about 5 minutes to install and it’s color is much prettier in person( not the yellow gold). You can literally hang these lights anywhere!,1
"I was tempted not to buy this because of the reviews. It's been up for a week and it works great. Don't know what's wrong with all those remotes not working correctly...Maybe they got bad batteries. Mine works perfectly from 15 feet away. Light dims great. Everything else is superb. Been up for a week, looks wonderful. Couldn't be happier with it.",1
I love how easy it is to install. It looks great and does the job it is intended for.,1
"This was a gift for someone who likes my 'electric picture light'. This was a major upgrade from mine. It has a remote control, is battery operated & is LED. Guess 20 years makes a lot of improvements:-)",1
"Very easy to install, love the timer on the remote",1
"Everything about this product has been great except for the brightness levels. When the lights are at 100% they’re fine but when I dim the lights, either manually or by pressing the preset “50%” button they change back to 100% after about a minute or so. They will dim perfectly whether I use the remote or the side button on the lights themselves but they will always change back to 100% when I would like to keep them dimmed for a while. Anyone else having this problem?! Or is it the way the product is designed?",1
"Super easy to install, brightness is great and I love that you can adjust the warmth of the light. I spray painted them because the gold finish as it came was pretty terrible. The only downside is that you have to have the remote within inches of the light for it to work, but that isn’t a huge deal for me. Great light!",1
So easy to put up. They add so much flare to my wall space and it was exactly what I needed.,1
"This accent lighting fixture came as advertised and in good condition. Easy to install. Being battery operated and coming with a nice little remote, the light can be easily adjusted as needed. However, this is a $25 product, so do not expect ""museum performance"". The light intensity and brightness is quite dimmed even on Max. is it worth the $25? - Yes! Is it something to light a high quality art? No",1
"It looks good. Instalation was easy, as it comes witha white paper that helps mark the spor for the scews. I thought the handle was flexible, but its not; you can only move it from side to side. The lightbulbs rotate toward wall or out, so you can adjust the light direction. The price may be a little steep, considering its plastic, but it does the job. Mine is the 13 inch. If there was a longer one, it would look better for my art, but i am satisfied overall.",1
I love the brightness and very easy to install.,1
"It’s mostly plastic, close up it looks really cheap. However it looks ok over my pictures. Not work the price though. At most it shouldn’t be over $10-$15 bucks.",1
I was looking for something easy to install but cute and with excellent quality and I found it! I Highly recommend it!,1
This was my 3rd set of lights and the first that was super easy to install! Just what I was looking for.,1
"This product met my expectations in all respects. It was easy to install and I really liked the remote control aspect. Levels of brightness, on and off buttons and the ability to change lighting color from white to museum-like yellow are just great. The price was affordable and the delivery was fast. Will be getting additional lighting units for three other pictures.

Later post: This unit has a built-in timer with four time units, which is extremely handy. You can punch in for 15, 30, 1 hour, or 2 hours and it will automatically shut off. What a great feature!",1
I purchased the black version as I’d read some reviews mentioning that the gold version is two-toned. The black finish is nice. The light is doing a pretty good job of illuminating my 47” wide painting. I wish there was a wider remote controlled version but this is good for the price. I used drywall screws for mounting instead of the screws that came with it.,1
Nice price and easy install. Could be a tad brighter,1
Remote control quit working in two weeks.very cheep remote but it’s made in china suprise.,1
Has 3 settings for the lights and displays beautifully!,1
 I really like this light and it’s function but unfortunately mine gave out after only a month. I’m hoping the replacement doesn’t do the same cause I like the way it lights up the artwork.,1
"Better than my expectations,",1
"I had been wanting a light for our picture, but I did not want a cord showing. This was perfect, and the finish matched our frame. The remote allows you to choose brightness, yellow or white light, timer, and dimmer. It is actually very nice, for the price. It was easy to install, and came with a built in level.",1
"I was a little nervous about ordering these, but they were super easy to install, love the variation in light color, as well as brightness levels. I ordered two; to my surprise, one remote will operate both of them without needing to use each remotes separately for each light. Would absolutely buy these again.",1
Very easy set up. Illumination for an original art work.,1
I use this to add additional light to my glow in the dark papyrus print I brought back from Egypt. It works well however I wish it was brighter and that the stem was flexible.,1
Would prefer if you could change the angle of hook on light. It works fine but doesn’t light bottom of picture well. This is my second one and great for price and ease of use.,1
"I love this light. While it is not the brightest picture light you could buy, I think it’s perfect for my needs. It is really attractive and the installation was so easy. It comes with a tiny level built in so that you know that you are hanging it straight. I love it!",1
Saw on tic tok and I love it. I now have four,1
Gives off a nice amount of light and remote works good. I did spray paint it to the color gold I wanted. I'd buy again.,1
Love this light! Super easy to install and operate. Adds the perfect touch to display any artwork. Highly recommend!,1
Looks great and does the job. My only complaint is that it burns up the batteries somewhat faster than I expected.,1
,1
I was so excited about it but unfortunately its not that bright in the dark,1
Beautiful Perfect for my artwork lighting choices are beautiful color is more copper than gold but still elegant I’ll keep them anyway would definitely buy more,1
These are a very practical and inexpensive means to illuminate artwork where power cords may present a distraction or no power source is available. Long lasting LED lights are powered by batteries. May require a modicum of creativity to mount them effectively to specific projects. (Mine required the addition of a plastic tab and hook/loop fastener strip.),1
Read the installation and yet felt unprepared. I'm still unsure if their up correct.,1
,1
The bright gold matched the frame on my picture perfectly. The best guidance to centering and leveling the light for installation. I wish all things came with it. Definitely buy this again if I need another light.,1
"The color is not all ""gold"" there is an orange shade to the arm and base of the fixture. Not overly noticeable.",1
"This item was built well, not something I say often. It is easily setup, mounted and includes a mounting template making it even easier to place it on the wall. The quality of light (throw and lumen) is excellent and the options range from warm lighting to cool lighting with a built-in dimmer that allows you to set the mood for the artwork being illuminated. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1
"Easy to use and nice features. I only use when I'm doing a portrait unveiling for my photography clients, so it has limited usage. Stayed on for as long as I needed it (a couple of hours). Don't know how long it will stay on before a battery change is needed, but it serves my purpose. Could be a bit brighter, but should work well for most situations.",1
"Easy to install, provide good light and for the price are an awesome deal!! My only complaint is that they are t gold or brass colored. They were pretty orange like a bad copper color. We spray painted them though and now they are perfect",1
Beautiful lighting,1
This little picture light is just what I was looking for!,1
I was really surprised how nice it looked in the hallway. Very reasonably priced. Very easy to put up. Love the two different lighting effects that you can choose from with the remote control. Comes fully assembled so all you do is insert the 3 AA batteries and install the wall.,1
"This light is great for illuminating wall hangings. The fact that it uses batteries removes the need for wires and electrician outlets, and enhances its appearance. The remote control works well, and the fact that you can have either ‘cool’ or ‘warm’ light highlights different aspects of the picture. The light is particularly good for small pictures, would need wider light for large ones, so measuring width of your picture for the light is important.",1
"I went for the cheaper version of this type of art light and it was the perfect choice. The remote is easy to use and the install is even easier. The timer is a great feature as well as the white and warm light settings.
Excellent buy for cost.",1
,1
I purchased 3 of these and very happy with them thay gave my jazz 3D art stand out even more.and i can change the lighting color to fit my social dinner moods.my friends was very impressed with what i paid for them and so was i.very happy customer.,1
"We were very happy with this light at first, but the brightness faded within three weeks. We replaced the batteries and it's bright again, but if we have to replace the batteries every three weeks or so, it will be a bit of an expensive and wasteful light.",1
"We wanted something classy but didn’t want to hardwire something into the wall. This fit the bill perfectly. Took two minutes to install, and works well. It’s adjustable for brightness and hue, with a timer. Love it so much, I just purchased another. It does have an orange tint to the plastic, but it’s not noticeable once installed.",1
"I was surprised at the quality for $26-$27. It’s easy to hang, the light options are great—cool, warm or somewhere in the middle. The light rotates up and down to light your picture. We are really pleased. The remote works well too and there is an in/off button on the light itself. It could be a bit brighter but for the price we are very happy.",1
This worked well for the space but if the arm extend a little further out it would have been better. Very good value and looks nice,1
"Looks great! Turned my art work into a priceless piece of art! The lighting is Amazing! Wish I could have this kind of lighting over my head all the time...lol! Draws everyones attention to the painting, when I have the light on. I like the looks of the light and makes my living room a classy room. A great purchase!",1
"This light works wonderfully, it's the remote that is a bit hit or miss. I originally gave this a bad review, but my husband got this light working, and it really is a good product.",1
"Drains batteries quickly, I got rechargeable lithium batteries.. solved the problem.",1
I had previously spent a fortune trying to hardwire picture frame lights around my home and could never get them in the correct place and if I later changed the size of frame it would come out wrong. This is a great product! I would highly recommend.,1
I like everything about the 4 I bought. My only dislike is the estimated 60 hours of battery life. But if you use the timer and the lights aren't on full bright who knows how long it will last. All in all I'm glad I bought them.,1
"A much beloved heirloom Japanese scarf, having been framed, deserved a spotlight to really show it off. This is a great little light for the price, the remote is easy to use, and the battery life (depending on brightness setting) is very good. Installation was simple, and changing the batteries is fast and easy. Definitely recommend, and we're considering another light for another art piece.",1
"Easy to install and operate. It is pretty bright, but definitely could be brighter.
Would recommend if you don’t have an option for wired lamp.",1
Very easy to put up and it looks great on,1
Fantastic product and super easy install,1
"Good light. cheaply bult, but looks nice ..just battery drain too fast",1
"Easy install, bought 2 and the remote works on both. Like the timer feature.",1
Great light but there are color variations we didn't know of at purchase. Its rose gold and gold. We thought it was all one color. We still hung it up and kept it. Would have preferred all gold.,1
"Works great, looks very nice, easy to install. The batteries will be easy to change after installed as well. The built in level makes installation easy. Varying light tone and dimming feature allow for the perfect look. Great product",1
The product is good looking and works very well. I did not install it but it did not take long to do for the person who did. I wish it were a bit brighter but it serves the purpose of illuminating the painting I’m using it for.,1
Great product for the price and looks and works mounted a very costly oil painting. It was easy to install and is the perfect size. The remote is an excellent accessory and the brightness choices are perfect.,1
Good for price,1
Wish the batteries would last longer. If you use this everyday you will have to change the batteries every week.,1
Just love and very satisfied with this product and I have already ordered 5. Touch of class and elegance over a painting!,1
"Could be a little brighter, still does the job.",1
"I love this lamp! Yes, the gold color is more like a bronze gold, but it looks so good! Easy installation and I really like that you can choose between warm or cold light.",1
"I get compliments on mine. I’ve now bought three. Kinda cool how you can position lights, choose bright or warm and there is a tiny level bubble in the back sleeve for easy install. If there’s a drawback it’s that it’s light weight plastic but for the price..that’s okay. You can’t tell by a glance",1
"These lights are great value especially for the price. They were very easy to install, the remote control has several features that allow to choose the level of brightness, white or warm light, and timer. I am very pleased with the lights.",1
I find this light saved me from all the problems of going the old way,1
"This product displays artwork beautifully and the remote offers many options including a timer. Also, one remote is all that's needed to operate multiple lights.",1
Absolutely love these! I bought two lights as a gift for my husband to hang over some of his canvas paintings in his office. Everything works as expected and looks amazing!! Will probably be buying more,1
Love it!,1
Does what I wanted,1
The only thing I would have like better is if it had a timer you could set to come on at the same time each night. Looks great and works well.,1
The bulb or battery ran out . We need replacement battery or bulb or both. Where do we find this?,1
Great product but uses up a lot of batteries quickly. I kept it on low and was putting it on every night. Now I only put it on a couple times a week at night.,1
I like the picture light but the remote seems to go through batteries quickly.,1
"I have been searching high and low for sconces that are battery powered and modern looking. These are a perfect fit above our art work. They are easy to install, and love that there are no cords for plug in.",1
"Great light for the price. Was referred by a friend.
I had ordered “ The Big Light “
By accident. Easy to say “The Big Light “ was not big . Luxways light is bigger and gold or brass color is nice.
Weird coincidence. Both lights seem to be made by the same manufacturer. The remotes operate both lights.
But overall the luxways light is very nice.",1
"1. this is very convenient and beyond easy to install.
2. it's NOT GOLD. this product is rose gold almost copper.",1
"The screw template made installation a breeze. It's mostly plastic, but doesn't look cheap at all. My picture doesn't do it justice. Love that the remote allows so many options & that there are no unseemly holes in the wall or cords. Wish it was brighter, but it does the job!",1
"Comes with remote, which is extremely easy to use. You can control the brightness, even has a timer. Very pleased with light!",1
Easiest to install I have ever encountered. A little brighter would be better. Easy to change setting from warm to daylight - just push a button. Separate button on remote for each setting option made everything very easy,1
"Our 50th Anniversary picture was done on the steps of a beautiful old home, now a bed and breakfast. There are 20 of us in the picture. When others come to my home one of the first things I do is turn on that light over the picture and watch their reaction. The light makes the picture come to life. Love it!!!",1
This art display light is one of my best investments to date. It does not look cheap and best of all it is easy to install and NO electrician is needed to do the installation. It comes with a built-in leveler and any person can install this.,1
Very easy to install. Provides good illumination for a picture or painting,1
"I wish the light was a little adjustable, my pic is tall and the light does not alume the entire picture.",1
It is pretty heavy. Does not work for the picture I had intended. Unable to position. Arm is not movable.,1
"It's almost perfect, my only problem is it's a big picture 3ft by 2ft and I SHUD of got a bigger one, my fault",1
"Love it. Easy to install. We’ll see how long the batteries last, but so far it is just what I was looking for in a wireless solution.",1
This light fixture is a perfect fit to light up my clock. I love that it’s battery operated and has a remote. We bought two more to put in my sewing room.,1
"Me agrado, lo practica, que es, y todas las funciones, del control remoto",1
Nice picture lights! They aren't metal on the actual light and back plate which is a bummer but for the price they are great.,1
I put this over my fancy calendar and it is perfect! Draws attention to anything it illuminates!,1
Luv this picture light. There are 2 different settings for light soft or bright and the remote has a timer with 3 settings you can also turn light on manually if you choose. Great light for the price. Slim unit very nice looking.,1
Bought this light to light up a 16x20 photo. It meets my expectations and beyond. Would highly recommend,1
Wish it was a little brighter,1
I had doubts about how long the batteries would last. Been three months and I turn it on for two to three hours a night. Timer feather is great. You can even select between warm and bright light. Dim it. Looks great especially since there is not a cord.,1
"Picture is gold - it’s more like a brass tone to it.
Don’t remember a remote with it.
Looks nice",1
"I wish the batteries lasted longer. It is very, very nice and glad to have it when I have company.",1
The product is easy to install and gives a warm nice light,1
"Looks and works well
Battery life is the only down side
Great option when hard wiring for art isn't an option",1
"As long as u DO NOT PICK WARM OR COOL. And u leave all the lights to work, and twist the lights down towards the art, it is great! My painting has some 3D acrylic affects that never showed up before I had this light to showcase them.",1
It is easy to install and lights up the picture for added emphasis. Looks and works well except the remote has to be within 6 foot to work.,1
I am so in love with this picture light! It gives my loft a luxe look. I always get compliments.,1
"Great light for the price. As other reviewers have stated, this does have an orange hue to it. I fixed that with a can of 18 karat gold spray paint that I bought at Michael’s. It’s perfect now.",1
"Great instructions, made for an easy install. Really like that there are 3 lighting effects to choose from. Remote works perfectly and has different timers- don't want to waste batteries! Great buy. I would purchase again.",1
I love this light!! It is very sleek and looks nice on the wall. Different lighting options are awesome and the remote works well. The timer is definitely a great feature.,1
"It has a very attractive look. I placed it above a Thomas Kinkade picture and it looks fantastic ,just received it today already up and going!!",1
I like the timer and the fact it will turn off by its self. I also like the way you can set it to daylight and also sunset.,1
Great Light with ability to change from daylight to soft and has timers for 15:30:45:60. Easy to install. Comes with drywall anchors:screws: template for drying and level in bracket. Love it. Getting two more to complete my highlight my art.,1
"Nice little light! I like the different settings on the remote (bright or soft light). The timer is a nice feature. My only minor complaint is that the color was more like a rose gold than a regular gold. It didn’t quite match our frame. However, you can’t really tell unless you walk right up to it. Overall, very satisfied with my purchase.",1
"At first I wasn't fond of the orange gold but when I put them up, it looked amazing! There are several different light settings as well. And I can use one remote for both lights. Very reasonably priced as well.",1
This light is perfect for my painting. The painting is located in a spot that doesn't have much light and this makes all the difference in the world. Very happy that I found this at a reasonable price.,1
"This works well and is what I needed. Color could be a bit better and brightness of light could be a bit brighter. But, for price and ease of install not bad at all.",1
A great little light. One caution: you don't want to use this (or any) picture light on a picture with glass. All you'll see is a reflection of the light.,1
"For the price you can’t beat it. Super easy to install - lightweight . The gold had a slight orange tint to it, so be mindful of that. I actually just taped over the light and spray painted ours with gold spray paint I had left over and then they were absolutely perfect.",1
"Love it , works beautifully, just a little top heavy , but overall works great !!",1
Nice lamp for our dart board...love the timer off option just wish it stayed brighter longer. Going thru batteries like hotcakes.,1
"a dear friend painted a lovely still-life that was in a dark corner in my new townhome -
this light solved the problem with little expense!",1
It is so easy to install. If I can do it... anyone can do it! It made this mirror that I designed “ pop” with color!,1
i love the remote control on this light.....goes from dim to bright. perfect for my aunts special painting..,1
okay,1
"Easy mounting, but for my larger frame the light only illuminated the top 6-10 inch.",1
The light dramatically changes the artwork and adds calming ambiance. Super cheap amd easy to install. Love the remote! Every home needs one!,1
This is my fourth LUXSWAY picture light. Easy to install and remote works perfectly.,1
"Thought it would be brighter. And yes, I turned it all the way up.",1
"Received item promptly, pleased with product.",1
I do enjoy this product. I just wish it was a bit brighter.,1
Liked the level built into the mount so you can hang straight..easy. Light not as bright as I hoped but just enough if the room is dark..,1
Just love this little light. We wanted it above our new Samsung Frame TV. It added just the right tough. We didn’t paint it and loved the color.,1
The light should be brighter if you have a picture larger than 11X14. plus mats.,1
It’s very attractive. Doesn’t give a huge brightness but adequate. I still think an excellent value.,1
The mount even has a built-in level and the remote is intuitive. Thought it was expensive but impressed by the build quality. Will buy again,1
"I really like this item, the only con that I have is that the batteries run down to fast, otherwise it is a great purchase",1
Nice for the money,1
"Used this as lighting for framed movie posters, in our media room. Very easy installation. Remote control works well, and is easy to use. There are multiple brightness settings, and also has a timer. Ended up being the perfect lighting solution, exactly what I was looking for.",1
Great light for 25$. I’d love to have one hardwired into the wall but I move my stuff around a lot. This is a great light for a family heirloom. I’m going to get a few more. Love it. Super easy to hang as well.,1
"This is pretty cool. It adds extra highlight for your picture frame. Especially for night time, it kinda focuses on the frame to make that picture frame look good.",1
Wish you could manipulate the neck of the light. Not bright enough to light it up well.,1
Great simple light to go in our kitchen. Easy to install but as others said the color is not a true gold all over. Closer to a copper color in some places.,1
"Beautiful light, 3 different settings and can be controlled on the light of by the remote. Easy to install with a paper to show where the screws should go and it has a level built in the back piece. Great lights.",1
"Easy install, remote works great, wish have AC power input. Not bright enough as expected.",1
battery life short... very very pretty looks like real brass its plastic,1
Easy to install. Everything you need is included to make sure the fixture is balanced. Attractive looking. Great price. Will purchase more.,1
"I used it to light an oil painting. The remote is wonderful, easy on and off, and never fails. I would like the light to be brighter but the ambient light it gives off is effective. The physical appearance of the fixture is very nice and super easy to install.",1
Very beautiful! Worked perfect for our art in our apartment. Also super easy to install!,1
"The remote control is very convenient. The lighting can be changed to 2 types of lighting controlled by the remote control.
The design of the light is minimal which is great and the eye focuses more on the painting or photo rather than the light itself. I order two and love them.",1
We like the choices of cool vs warm light,1
Love this light adds a touch of elegance to the living room. Easily to install and hang overall great purchase.,1
It’s rare to find something at this price that both does its job and has great extras! Includes thoughtful instruction details and super little remote.,1
I love it! Easy to install and great to set the mood in your home with the different brightness & tones!,1
Great little light! Battery operated. Remote with lots of color and dimmer options.,1
"Very easy to install. Looks nice. Covers a large area of pictures!
Timer is nice it has several times to choose from.",1
Very nice product I just assumed it turned off and on automatically once you set the timer but it doesn't,1
"Looks nice and easy to setup. Definitely not high end, but was happy with the quality given the price.",1
"This light is awesome! Perfect for our dark hallway. Light is great, easy to mount and remote has lots of options and good range. Highly recommended",1
The design is fine and the installation was easy. I intend to buy more.,1
"This remote controlled picture light is perfect for lighting up a work of art that I love to look at. The light was easy to assemble and install. I wouldn't hesitate to buy another. In fact, I'm planning to do just that.",1
"Cheaply made.
Did not work",1
"The light was slightly lopsided. I could not get it straightened, so it looks lopsided hanging over my picture.",1
I was very pleased with this product. Worked great and having 3 different color lights really show off my picture!,1
 Easy to use! Easy to mount! Love the lighting settings! Comes with a Remote!,1
"Just what I needed. So easy to operate and many options to get just the right lighting. Looks great on the wall, too. Adjustable and slim design makes you focus more on the picture rather than the light. I bought two (gold and black colors) and love them.",1
Three stars for the ugliest looking remote you’ve ever seen- but everything else is perfect Bd wonderful,1
Like the remote. But don’t lose it. It’s small,1
This light is super cool. Remote control definitely a bonus,1
Perfect for my RV,1
Brightness could be a little better. Looks good on my wall above a memorial picture in glass.,1
"Such a nice light for those favorite pictures and soft lighting for your walls with choices of color and brightness.
I love them, I have purchased two.",1
Works great! Mounting takes less than 15 minutes. You can rotate the lighting elements to provide more or less illumination. Remote works fine. No complaints.,1
This picture light works perfectly for us. We like it so well that we ordered and are using four more!,1
,1
Light up a picture on a shaded wall,1
Looks very nice.,1
Simple to install comes with all mounting hardware a level built into the mounting bracket,1
Not as bright as I thought.,1
Looks nice and like the control option,1
The light is lit by four D batteries and we have it on in the hall day and evening. A great product.,1
Easy to install. Looks very expensive but worth the money!,1
The best part is the remote! My husband bought this to light up a painting we hung on a wall. We were looking for something like this forever at other hardware stores and couldnt find it but here! Great produt. Thanks Amazon!,1
Lights up a dart board just fine. Controls are great. Color looks cheap,1
"These are very nice lights. Regarding the color, they are gold, gold like a gold plate charger; however, when the light is on, they take on a even golder display more like the gold handle. For the price of these lights, my art displays look very nice.",1
Love it. Used above large painting. Easy to install and use.,1
"I had a portrait done of my Granddaughter and hung it in my dimly lit hallway. My new light not only lights the portrait perfectly (in many different settings), but it's pretty and they look like they belong together :)",1
"Perfect for hallway art lighting! It’s beautiful at night. Easy to install, handy remote. Inexpensive! Very attractive.",1
Easy to install; lightweight enough for command strips ; completed overall project look,1
Works beautifully and has a few different settings for the light control - exceptionally pleased.,1
Easy to install and love the remote and light timer,1
Good product for being battery operated. Great price!,1
"This product was missing inside the box

Please send me the item!",1
Love the easy installation. I love the way it looks.Highlight is perfect. The warm light or white choice is great as it help changing the mood...,1
The only thing I don’t like is to replace all of the batteries which is too soon all the time,1
Works ok but a bit small for my 3' wide print.,1
"i have an 1898 family oil portrait of great great grandma Alice.
she needed better lighting!",1
it is the perfect size and was extremely easy to install. My only negative was I wish it was a little bit brighter. Overall it's an outstanding product.,1
Easy to install on wall due to little bubble level attached to the back. Brightens my painting in a dark corner in living room.,1
It looks like it cost much more than it did!,1
Great art light. EZ to install and use. Remote has timer and brightness adjustable except it is not that bright. More like a low level adjustable light. The curve on the light is non adjustable but works. Highly recommend,1
Great light. Looks really expensive. I want to buy more.,1
Worked as advertised. Very impressive for the money. Brighter would be better; but it's pushing about as many lumens as it can with batteries and LEDs.,1
"This was easy to install. It has two lighting effects, which actually offer differing aspects of the painting! Cool and warm tones! It has a timer, too. Best of all - no wires! I cannot stand wiring all over!",1
Nice light no needs for cords anymore. Wish was a littler brighter but works,1
"It looks very nice, easy to install and the remote makes it easy to turn the light on and off.",1
Like the remote. But wish it was wider and brighter,1
"This light is WAY better than others in the same price category. Very easy install, love the different color settings (warm or cool and full or half light), even has a timer. 100% satisfied!",1
She wanted something to mount on the wall to highlight a small relief carving that she has had for years. This light really does make the carving 'pop'.,1
They are very nice.,1
not as bright as i wanted,1
Can't open the remote control to change battery. Remote is not working.... only had it 4 months.,1
"Attractive, choose warm or cool light, and timed ""on"" programs.",1
Perfect,1
Very nice.,1
I was very pleased with this purchase. I love the remote is compatible with additional units and the auto shut off. Affordable and seemed like a good value for the price.,1
As a beautiful addition to display my wall art.,1
Easy to install,1
"Easy to install, nice remote control, brightness. Beautiful",1
nice,1
"It worked great, but it didn't work for what I wanted it for.",1
RH on a budget! Looks just like expensive RH lights.,1
Nice light. Wish it was much brighter!,1
I loved this item.,1
After I bought first one I was so pleased that I bought two more! Easy install and looks really nice! Brightens up art in dim areas of room and really gives it a professionally decorated feel!,1
"Very convenient, easy to control.
I was expecting a brighter more illuminating light. It is priced fairly.
I like it, but would look at other brands if purchasing another one.",1
"Great lights for paintings and prints. Light. Affordable. Look great. What's really nice is that once the brightness and color is adjusted the way I want them to be, they turn on again with the same settings.",1
Beautifully showcases paintings,1
The quality was not very strong.,1
We bought this for one of my father in law's collections. He really likes it so far. It was easy to mount and the light is nice and bright.,1
That it made of plastic.,1
I used this light over the picture of each child.,1
The paint look so different now ..in love!!,1
Very easy to install.,1
Took me 10 minutes or less to install and another few minutes to adjust light perfectly. It has a built in level for easy installation.,1
I love ALL the options for remote-clever design w timers and dimmers. I even love the easy installation with a little level on the back! Good value! So rare these days.,1
Lighting a picture.,1
"GREAT PRODUCT IT WAS EASY TO INSTALL JUST TOOK 10 MINUTES AND THE FEATURES GAVE ME MORE OPTIONS ON
HOW I WANTED TO ILLUMINATE MY HANGING WALL PICTURES..",1
"It's nice for the price, remote is interesting....",1
Perfect for our new picture. Lights up with remote. Great quality. Looks like a gallery print now.,1
"Great
Product and VERY reasonable priced. Shows off the artwork in fantastic light! Different choices of shades and all done with a remote; no standing on chairs/ladders to turn on/off!",1
Excellent like at a showroom,1
Love this item. Purchased this for my parents painting. I purchased the gold because their frame is the same color and texture. The light has a ton of options from the remote!,1
Such a nice light for over our electric piano! The 15 minute timer rocks & no cords. Really like the dimmer & different lighting options too. So glad we purchased this!,1
"I like it very much, easy to install, good value for the money and the remote works great!",1
Great Value!,1
"It really works well for the money. I attached it to the ceiling really easily. It's kind of a funny color, not gold and not brass, but metallic orange. It's okay though.",1
Pretty nice,1
Batteries last a really long time. Good brightness. The warm white color or cold white are equally bright. The remote control with dimmer and timer is handy.,1
Perfect for small dark areas!,1
Love the easy install and settings!,1
Great addition to a clock that is hanging about 15 feet high in my cathedral ceiling. It gives great light and I really like the timer features I highly recommend,1
Works nicely to light up one of my photographs hanging in our hallway. It's a bit flimsy...but it should be just fine.,1
Easy to install and a lovely light to show off a taxidermy bat mounted in a beautiful gothic shadowbox. I plan on ordering a few more for my photos.,1
Overlightening Painting,1
Nice,1
We used the light to illuminate some pictures on the wall & they work perfectly. Love the remote control. We installed it with Command tape.,1
"This light is perfect for pictures. It looks great, the remote is easy to utilize and I will be purchasing again for other projects I'll be doing in our home.",1
This picture light is great. I especially like the remote allowing me to set the light for different auto turn-off capability. The brightness is perfect for pictures.,1
It all seems great so far!,1
low cost/features,1
Put this on a picture in our patio and it is beautiful at night. love the remote.,1
Makes a dark painting glo,1
I have a dark room with no electric so l am redecorating it to be very light. I bought this to illuminate artwork. Sleek and works great for the job,1
Very nice!,1
I waited 4 years to put a light over my favorite picture and I didn’t think I could like it anymore until I put the light on it!!,1
Delivered very quickly! Wonderful light!,1
Does not work well with glass in a frame because the light reflects in the glass.,1
"Well made, good quality...remote is great also!",1
Nice light decor over my hallway picture.,1
So easy to install and the perfect light source for an original painting.,1
"Great light ! I just can’t have it all day ON
I installed on my office over a paint
Everybody loved it
Me too",1
"These are the best for hanging over a picture framed or not. This is the third order of these lights, as I love using them.",1

Light weight and easy to install,1
Everything was just as decride,1
Works great. Super easy to install.,1
Easy to up. Nothing to it!,1
Ez install,1
I am so please with the way this inexpensive light looks and works. But batteries are difficult to replace if you are short,1
Used the lamp to highlight one of my photographs on our studio tour.....exactly what was needed for visitors to draw attention to the image.,1
Love how classy it looks and to top it all off no wires!!!!(Just 3 AA batteries) I plan to order many more 😍,1
This was exactly what I was looking for to help showcase some of my husband sports memorabilia.,1
easy to install and priced right,1
Love the options for type light. Can be soft white or daylight. Wonderful flexibility.,1
"I purchased 2 of these lights and they are very nice,
One of the lights did not include the remote which is really disappointing",1
Easy to install; lights up the painting,1
product was awsome,1
Great product for the price ! Very easy to install.,1
Works great.,1
Whoever came up with this idea was the genius,1
"Easy to install, added great light and priced fair",1
Great purchase,1

Works well.,1
Looks great over painting.,1
"Play Video

"Easy install, easy to operate. Does a great job on the picture we are using it on.",1
This a great product. Did exactly what I needed to do. Also amazing customer service.,1

Are use it for pictures and paintings and it’s working fine so far,1
Very easy to install works great love how easy it will be to replace batteries.,1

"The first remote that came in the pack did not work at all. I returned it and ordered a new replacement one. This remote works just fine - although you have to be close to it, pointed directly at it, and press firmly - and the button on the light itself works as described. The lights aren't very bright, but suits our purpose. Installation was easy, and it comes with a nice level so you don't have to measure it. For $25 it gets the job done, but don't expect to have your socks knocked off.",1
The light is everything it says it is. Very easy to install. Has a remote that works from quite a distance and the light gets the job done.,1
"I am a professional artist, I have a studio in my house and display rotating work in our living space. I have clients comment on how well displayed my work is in my home. These are not fancy or expensive but they make a big difference",1
"light weight, good color- easy to use with remote control and the battey powered spot light for art is beautiful",1
"I'll admit I had really low expectations for this. But I was simply looking for a way to highlight a large piece of wall art without needing to deal with a cord to hide. This light is awesome in appearance, and although it's plastic, it's not flimsy. The gold leans more towards rose gold, but hey....it's gold and that's a fun theme I have in this room. It has a low and high light output setting, which is good because I'm not a fan of the bright white LED bulbs (even the high setting isn't obnoxiously white). An added bonus I didn't even know about is that it has timeframes you can set it to stay on - 30, 60, 90 or 120 minutes. This is great for me so I don't have to wonder if I forgot to turn it off or not. I probably should have dove into the mounting instructions more, because it took me a couple tries to get it on correctly. But the mounting bracket even has a built in ""level"" for easy straight mounting. Overall I'm extremely happy with this purchase!",1
A lot nicer than another type I purchased that was bulky and heavy. Light weight and easy to install Just two small screws I was able to just use a screwdriver. I love that the remote has a timer and the lights are rotatable. I wish the light was a tad brighter but might be too much of a glare then on glass.,1
The installation is very easy and neat. The light focus is spread out which is good. There is fair amount of adjustability for moving the light's focus vertically. Overall material is cheap but doesn't look cheap once mounted. Overall good product for the price. I have one more painting to hang and would order another one of these lights. I wish it was a little more brighter.,1
"Wish I could make the light a little brighter. But it does the job! Not going to lie, it's a bit bulky but it fit behind our painting well. A cool feature is that the lights rotate. You can change the color of the lighting from warm to cool lighting. I prefer the warm lighting. The remote also has a timer! Overall a good buy",1
The first one I bought did not come with a remote I was sent another one and got the remote but had to return the rest of the product back to UPS kind of hassle for the consumer but in the end it worked out. The glare is not as bad in person. It also has a little water level on it to help with leveling just that little added help. It could use a little more range of light or my print maybe a little smaller.,1
"The gold is very yellow, but I don't mind. I wanted this to not only highlight my mango pastel art, but also light up the sink at nighttime because this area gets really dark. It COULD be a little brighter, but I shouldn't complain because it's better than what I had before.",1
The people who designed this lamp put some thought into making it easy to install. A tiny level bubble is built in to the mounting bracket!!!! That makes it easy peasy to hang it correctly. It’s the first time I’ve seen that. There’s a very helpful paper template too. I think the tiny level has potential to make it much easier to mount things correctly. It’s inclusion shows genuine concern for the customer.,1
"This is an easy 5 star review. Changed the vibe of my foyer by adding this over a painting. It took it to another level . Easy to install, remote works great and looks classy. I bought 2 more! Thank you!",1
"This is an excellent addition to a darker gallery wall in my home. I am unsure how long the batteries will last, and I was disappointed in the finish. The face was chipped in transit and it obvious with illuminated.",1
"There are far too many Chinese cheap products that come up under a search for this type of light, so let me make this simple: this is the one you want. See my photo; this is a 27x41” poster, as I know there are different sizes.
The plate mounts to the wall, even has a tiny level in it so you can’t screw it up, and the light slides over the plate. Excellent quality; three types of illumination; adjustable; has remote…what else can you ask for?",1
"I like it has a remote, Bright light, low light. Easy to install light weight. I recommend buying this light. It’s not just for lighting a painting. You might just need brightness in a small space.",1
A little more bronze than gold but still looks and works great!,1
"Looks beautiful and makes a significant difference in the room. Easy to install - appreciate the built-in leveler. We used screws but tape likely would have worked. Adjustable. The multiple light settings, brightness and timer options are great. Excellent product, purchased two and about to purchase one more.",1
I loved the light fixture style however I didn’t appreciate that the golds were two different colors. One brass and the other one a darker gold finish. I spray painted the hole thing after covering the lights and it came out amazing. Checkout the photos,1
This light is super easy to install! Even has a built in level! I could not be happier! Looks great! A+++,1
"We just wanted a battery operated picture light. We love the additional options that are available on the remote. There is button for a yellow light or white light, 50% lighting or 100% lighting also a plus and minus button for brightness. The variety of timing options are nice. Each light is movable outward or inward. This light is a winner for our needs!",1
I love the light. My Dad had this desert landscape in his family for more than 70 years. It came a really ugly frame. Updated the frame and added the light. Love it now.,1
Love my lamps. Super bright and easy to assemble. I don’t have complaints,1
Easy to install and exactly what I wanted! Remote control is the bomb!,1
"Easy to install, could be brighter. Remote functions work as described but longest timer setting is 120 minutes. Would be nice to include a 6hr on 18hr off feature.",1
Its very subtle and attractive. Easy easy to prepare and install. I wish it was a little brighter.. but otherwise i love it! The remote has so many options!,1
The light is easy to install and really beautiful. Just what I needed for the space,1
This is a great lamp for using to light artwork in the evening.,1
" Remote controlled, no plug in needed, timer options. Just beautiful!",1
"I like it a lot, purchased several ones for all my pictures",1
Just got it today and it took less than a minute to hang. It is really lightweight so I was able to hang it with command strips which is really nice. The built in level is a good feature too. The gold color looks kinda cheap in person. Overall it’s great though. Hoping it lasts!,1
"I'm impressed with this picture light, it's plastic but looks like metal ,has several settings and a remote!",1
This is a super easy install and adds a lot to the picture. Highly recommended.,1
Liked the easy installation. Liked how it lighted the picture. Liked it so much that we ordered 2 more for other pictures.,1
I’ve already gotten so many compliments on this and have sent people the link to buy it. I love it.,1
"No need for cords, outlets, and the lighting options are endless! Coming back for more!",1
Everything about ordering and receiving the light was great. Installation was easy too. Because it's battery operated the light intensity is a bit weak but it works for now.,1
"Very easy to install, and works great!",1
Very pretty and easy to hang picture light if you don’t want to hardwire. disappointed mine came damaged with a noticeable dent . Will have to re order,1
Very easy to use and install. I wish they were rechargable instead of battery operated.,1
Great light and uses minimal battery if not left on 24/7,1
Love it!!!! It is absolutely perfect!! Easy to install!,1
"These are affordable and give me the look I was going for, but I bought two at two different times and they are not the same color. I ordered the same ones. I’m going to have to spray paint them and probably use Rub n Buff to get the look I want.",1
This is such a great product!,1
Perfect 5 stars! Super easy to install. Looks like a gallery piece. Perfect brightness. Love it.,1
Super easy to install. Remote is great. Black option is plastic. Looks cheap.,1
I am in love with this light. Has so many different features including a timer. Can’t go wrong. Add it to your cart and enjoy. Blessings,1
Installed this light over my desk. It is perfect! It even has different settings.,1
Like it and would buy it again,1
Everything was adjustable so you could get the light just so!,1
"Play Video
 I get so many compliments on these. I just bought 3 more!!",1
I bought the black ones. Super easy install! Very happy with this purchase!,1
Very pleased with this product they are a perfect accent to my home,1
"Awesome Product, super easy to set up. I wants a shadow effect for a wine wall and it was perfect.",1
"Removed a star because the base and light are a different shade of gold color than the stem because the stem is metal and the base/light piece are plastic. But for the price, its good. The mounting piece has a built in level that made it very easy to hang and the lights do a great job for what i needed them for. Will prob buy again and just give it all a coat of rustoleum gold spray paint to make it look more uniform.",1
"The lights are easy to use and lighting is great!
You can adjust the light to point more towards the wall or down wards just by twisting it!
Great price for the product!",1
"It’s a good brightness, easy to install, even had a little level on the back plate (which was removable for more accuracy). I also liked how you could turn the lights more towards the art or more straight down if you would want.
My negatives are it is a very yellow, plastic-y, shiny gold. Not really any different than shown on the listing but I guess I was hoping for the best when I bought it. Another thing I didn’t care for is that you can see all 6 individual led lights if putting it on something reflective.
I did really like the options on the remote. Not sure why anyone would want the cool light as opposed to the warm but it’s nice it has that option. Also love that you can adjust the brightness.",1
Love it!,1
" Easy to install, great addition",1
These are great to have. We have been using them for my boyfriends artwork around the house. With some Baroque frames it looks like a museum. Will submit photo soon. The remote is great and east to use. The batteries i feel like drain fast but that's expected.,1
,1
I love it! Very elegant! It is dimmable. Only downfall is that it requires batteries. The other one I have allows you to pull it off and charge.. but that is the only complaint. It’s perfect for my entryway,1
"If you are looking for way to accentuate an artwork, this light is the answer. Love the fact that it has a remote control. It allows me to turn it on and off when lying on my sofa. What a breeze!",1
"It was super easy to install as it has a built in level, uses 3 AA batteries and a remote that lets you change the power up & down and a built in timer.",1
"I really like the look of it and it's a great value option for the others that retail double or more than double the price.
Most of the lamp is plastic but it is hard to tell once you have it installed which took me less than 3 minutes to set up.
My only complaint is that I would like for the yellow light to be more warm but I believe that is personal preference.",1
"Easy to install, control… looks great above the bar",1
Looks good easy to light.,1
Excellent,1
Really love this on at night to highlight the painting and to add subtle light in the room. The three light settings are great. I prefer the warm light to match my lamps. Had to use fairly strong double tape to make it stay which is fine. But a definite way to make you feel like your house is a bit bougie!,1
"Best product ever. Batteries last a long time and I have bought several and plan to buy more. Super easy to install, love the built in level! Superior product and I rarely give reviews. Highly recommend this product. Makes any artwork seem like it’s from the Louvre!",1
I loved all the items I've purchased through Amazon,1
Great,1
Battery operated easy to install.,1
Excellent,1
Difficult to install,1
"I like them, I bought them 4 times already.",1
Looked a little out of place for our taste. But very nice product.,1
Didn’t want to mount yo wall so I used two sided tape. Holds well. The remote works great on timer and the amount of light chosen. Looks really good at end of a hall on painting.,1
"Absolutely love these lights, used them over my Goblet paintings, it makes them look amazing at night. The fact I can adjust the brightness and set the timer is amazing! Will be buying more to add to my living room and study",1
"This has been a really nice picture light. It's light weight , looks great and the remote is a plus. I have a few paintings and this light makes them stand out.",1
It's perfect!!! It works great easy to install and gives that extra touch to my pictures. Just what I need it ❤️,1
Suitable for small to medium size wall art. Liked the many control features. Company quickly response to questions.,1
"Fácil de colocar, el color un poco amarillento pero la retoque con pintura en aerosol negra solo chispazos para dar un toque de oro viejo y el resultado genial 🥰",1
Oil painting illumination. Works perfectly.,1
This lamp design is most appealing and very lightweight. I will order more for our home.,1
"The product was very easy to install. There is a panel in back that comes off and it even has a mini level on it. The only thing that didnt work was the anchor bolts it came with, ended up pushing one right through into the wall.

The product looks nice hanging up. Up close the curved metal pole is a different color (more yellow gold) than the metallic looking plastic the rest of it is made out of. It isn't obvious when it is mounted.

I find it very functional. Two light options and both look nice. Remote works well. Have not tested the timers out but it is a nice feature.",1
"Works better than I expected.
Very happy with it.",1
Absolutely PERFECT! They make it easy to hang as well,1
Great product and easy installation! Looks great and works like a charm! Highly recommend!!!,1
"The light looks very elegant.I fell in love with it at first glance. It' perfect for our art photo wall. It's battery run so there's no messy wiring. Remote controller makes it easy to control. Looks like it belongs in a art gallery. This was designed with love. Futuristic, elegant, well thought out.Highly recommended.",1
It’s so pretty and it’s not heavy it’s easy to install just the perfect touch,1
"Play Video
 It definitely makes my living room feel more luxurious!!! I love it",1
Love how easy this is to use. Perfect for showing off our paintings.,1
Perfect light for my artwork,1
"These are lightweight & made of plastic, but from afar you can't tell. A single remote will work for multiple lights which is nice. Easy to operate & installation was super simple. You can choose a warm or cool tone light depending on your mood. These look fantastic & even if they don't last a super long time, I am happy!",1
"Extremely easy to install, looks amazing! I love it.",1
"Nice product , it could be a cheaper price since the material is very cheap overall 7 out of 10",1
Very nice quality but could be a bit brighter. Would buy again.,1
"Love how bright it gets, also with changing the colors of the light. It doesn’t come with batteries you have to buy them yourself. 3 (AA Batteries are needed) highly recommended if you want that luxury feel of your art work or even for your mirrors.",1
"Remote a plus and brightness is
great.",1
"Nice light, timer is a little short, we needed to keep resetting to keep on all evening.",1
OK,1
"The unit looks great, just doesn’t highlight enough for my liking.",1
 I like that its wireless. I wish I could buy more than one that could be combined with one remote. I forgot and left it on over night with brand new batteries and they died. Over all I would buy again.,1
"I saw this on a favorite YouTube channel of mine and decided to order it for some artwork. It looks really good and has a nice, modern look to it. I never keep it on unless I’m showing it to someone but I feel like the batter have really drained quickly, causing the light to be super dim on its higher level. Could just be the dollar store batteries though! That being said I already ordered a second one. Im happy with it and recommend it!",1
"Se mira bien, gracias.",1
Perfect for the picture in the darker corner. Love it,1
This light is so cute over my picture! It is easy to install and looks very classy!,1
I love it,1
I love the light and the fact that it is battery operated and comes with a remote is a plus. It also comes with a installation diagram and level which came in hand. I did have to use the anchors that came with the screws and still had issues but this is on me and not the product.,1
Painting,1
"I used my light over an antique painting. I like how you can change the light from a golden glow, to a cool blue. It is super-easy to install. The price point was good as well. I have purchased 3 of them. There were other reviews which stated that the gold color was more of a rose-gold. It is more of a bronze-gold color, but that goes really well with antique-gold picture frames. You can also adjust and angle the lights accordingly. They were very easy to install. All in all, a very good purchase.",1
love that i have the look of a pre-wired picture light. i would recommend. i purchased EIGHT different ones and this one looked the best for the price range.,1
For the price you can't beat it.,1
Everything was as expected. Very happy with the purchase!,1
It makes picture stand out and look museum looking.,1
"Very pleased with this product, love the look, especially the level to assist with the ease with f
Installations",1
This light was a great value for the money. The light is not super bright but I like it soft. Works well for my space & I love the remote.,1
Exactly as expected. Will order more!,1
"I had moved into a new house and had my decorator come in and do my foyer before our housewarming party. We chose these pictures, but she said we needed a class of elegance to the farmhouse look, and she installed these two “museum art lights”. I figured out afterwards that you can change the temperature. I usually keep them on 50% warm and 50% cool color. Sometimes I choose warm, and sometimes I choose cool, it depends on how I feel at the time. I put pictures of both to show you the difference.",1
"Everything is fine but it’s not what I expected, I didn’t read that it doesn’t last long and that is what I was looking for but then if you are looking for a occasionally light this is perfect if not better get a plug in one",1
Nice inexpensive starter light to accent art or paintings,1
Love all the buttons and options.,1
Balcony,1
"I love that came in one day, they are light weight and easy to install. They have settings for brightness and color tones.",1
" Perfect for what I needed and wanted, looks like a nice brass lamp, nobody will know different. Love the different settings and the fact it has a remote with timer.",1
" These picture lights are pretty good quality for the price. I needed three to install over my artwork so I didn’t want anything too expensive. They are plastic, but once installed you can’t tell. The remote is great, and allows you to use two different color settings. I painted the ends of mine gold with rub and buff to give them a bit more detail. Overall very happy with them. Keep in mind that they do extend out quite a bit from the wall so I turned the light part of the fixture as far down as possible so you don’t see it.",1
Just arrived and will use for wall art and instructions seem clear and easy.,1
"This is so much nicer than I thought it would be, and at a terrific price. Installation was a snap. I bought one and will definitely get more. This is a really great cordless solution for smart looks and occasional use.",1
so beautiful and they are so easy to install I like that comes with the leveler to see if it straight Also it comes with three remotes one for each late but one control works for all,1
We wanted a light for a painting in our living room snd found this light. It is battery operated with a remote control so eliminates an ugly cord hanging on the wall. The dimmer feature and color of the light are what sold us and it is a great way to accent any picture or painting.1,1
Excellent,1
"I added this light above a piece of wall art and it really ties it together. Love the gold, the remote control is easy and assembly is a breeze. There is a piece on the back that makes it so easy to install!",1
Very nice. I like the colir..sort of a gold/ rose gold. Worked fine for me. Needs 3 AA batteries. Has a leveler on the back. Nice touch. Perfect for what I wanted.,1
Absolutely gorgeous. Love the control options. A must have accent lighting piece for any decor piece.,1
We used it to light a print we hung where there was no power available! Remote makes using very easy. It is a nice compliment to the picture and frame! This is our 2nd. one we own. ; ),1
Works just as described and does just as described. This was worth every dollar.,1
"Simple to install, happy with light output, very adjustable for light direction/ brightness/ three color temps/ and nice timer feature. Really helps this metal art pop!!!",1
This product is amazing. I bought it and then my brother saw it & ordered. My best friend saw it and ordered. I saw it on YouTube the girl name was DIY with KIVA and she had a link and that is how I bought it.,1
"A very nice addition to our entry hall, illuminating our stain glass piece above our front door. It is very attractive and easy to install and operate.",1
"Bought this light mainly due to the remote control. Unfortunately, no remote was in the packaging. Seriously considering returning this item.
My original review was 1 star.
Luxway reached out to me concerning the missing remote and their desire to make things right. Luxway sent a complete picture lamp that included the remote. The remote works flawlessly - no issues with the timers or the dimmer. Luxway gets a 5 star from me.",1
Love this light! It is not as bright as I would have liked but it was very easy to install (with a built in level!) and it looks great!!,1
Looks good easy installation easy use,1
Works just as described with several brightness and color tone options. Convenient remote control and battery operated for easy installation. Looks a bit cheap in person but for the price it does what it’s meant to do.,1
Was easy to install and works well. It has a battery life of 12 hrs. Rechargeable.,1
"We put these over the frames that hold our kids art work. It really adds a nice touch to them.
One remote will work on multiple which is nice and convenient.
The timer function is great as well.",1
Easy to install and works exactly as described.,1
Great product and quality,1
"I’m actually very pleased with this product! It is actually better than my expectations!
Easy installation! Amazing result!
I will definitely buy more of these!!!",1
"I think this item is a good dupe to a very expensive picture light. I think it looks a little plastic looking when you first open it up, but once it’s on the wall, you can’t really tell. Definitely a good affordable option that gives off the same effect as an expensive light.",1
I like the look of the light and overall easy to install and looks really nice. Also it is a bonus having both LED and an alternative soft light look (almost incandescent). There is some flexibility in adjusting the light itself but the one thing that would have improved this light is a longer flexible arm. I find the light does not really illuminate well the lower half of my painting and a flexible arm could have solved this problem.,1
"Everything was so easy to install, and was better than expected.",1
"This is an elegantly designed light with well thought out features for varying light temperature and brightness. The remote functions including a timer which is a particularly good idea for a battery-powered light. But the light is not very bright so it was not at all suitable for the 36"" x 24"" picture for which it was purchased. It would be very good for up to about 11"" x 14"". the design is minimalist which keeps it unobtrusive and not distracting from the item illuminated but the result is that there is no shade over the light to keep all the light on the picture and prevent the lighted LEDs being seen directly by the viewer.",1
Pour un tableau,1
Improve the remote.,1
"It’s a nice lamp but for my mom who I bought it for, wasn’t able to manage remote control. Wish they had power to it/ plug in. Goes through batteries too fast if they want light on all the time but good for average person. Very elegant lamp.",1
Ok,1
we loved our lights. Couldn’t be better. Recommended.,1
It looks great and works well,1
Super,1
"I really enjoy looking at this library light fixture, looks beautiful and it adds focused light into a small object which is my shelf wit Christmas decorations at the moment. Love how easy it is to turn it on and off with the tiny remote control which also provides 3 different light shades, warm , bright and dimmed white. Happy with this purchase, it was easy to install.",1
"I was a little hesitant after reading some reviews, but I am so happy with this purchase! It arrived quickly, well packaged. Super easy to install with all hardware and even a handy template. I light it every day for the past month, and so far the batteries have held up and have not been replaced yet. I also love the adjustable lighting and timer! Highly recommend. Great value!",1
Pour une peinture,1
"The product was easy to install. The remote is very convenient and offers a number of options for lighting level, timer, etc. looks very nice with my print.",1
Honestly great customer service and solved my issue. Highly recommend them!,1
"J'ai utilisé ce produit afin d'éclairer une toile installée dans mon salon qui lorsque le soir arrivé était dans un endroit sombre, maintenant la lumière lui redonne toute sa splendeur.",1
Makes my art POP!! So good. Built in level for mounting helps so much.,1
"Très satisfaite, belle apparence, finition impeccable. Livraison rapide. Correspond à la description et à mes attentes.",1
J'ai reçu plus vite que la date estimée; les 3 sortes d'éclairage sont fabuleux; l'aspect délicat donne un beau cachet. Très heureuse de mon choix,1
ITS NICE,1
This is a tremendous light for the price. Looks great and the warm and cool lighting differential is superb. Not to mention the time and light volume options. Picture depicts warm light option. Exceeded expectations.,1
"We spray painted gold to match decor, would be nice if offered in different colours",1
I am very happy with this product. I would have given a third option for the intensity and colour of the light but it is pretty OK,1
"It’s perfect and looks fantastic!
I wasn’t expecting it to be as good as it was!
But I was surprised with the results...",1
"Les agradezco su profesionalismo . Estoy seguro que el producto funciona , solo este llegó dañado . De hecho pueden validar y les he comprado otros 4 del mismo .

Gracias y saludos .",1
Love the remote different degrees of light would buy again!,1
"Great in my lounge
Great for when the power goes out
I love the way you don’t have lamps around for little hands .
Love the way it looks
Puts out great amount of light",1
"Looks great
Installed easily
Has multiple settings.",1
Magnifica !,1
Muy fácil de instalar y muy práctico,1
